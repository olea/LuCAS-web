<P>Here you write a little paragraph about you. What you do, who you 
are etc...
</P>

<H4>Abstract:[Peque&ntilde;o sumario del art&iacute;culo]</H4>
In the &quot;Abstract chapter&quot; you write a little summary about your
article:<br>
This article is an example article which shows how to use the 
the _LF_ article template format. This format is used as a internal format
for EVERY article. We call the format also meta format as it is only
the internal format.<br>
The format described in this document is valid from version lfparser-0.6 on.

<h2>What is the template format?</H2>

<p>At _LF_ we use an internal html file format. This is a very
simple html file which can then easily be converted into the final
article format. We call this template format also meta file format.
</p>

<H2>What is a meta file format?</H2>
<P>A meta file format is something that is only used during development
and it is not intended to be the final format in which documents are published.
The advantage of such a file format is that you can change the layout of
the final articles without the need to re-write the articles. 
It is also easier to feed information about the articles into a database as 
the articles have a in the meta file format a very strict structure.
</P>
      <table bgcolor="#f8dca8" width="150" align="right" border="0" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="5" >
        <tr>
          <td>
            <center>
              <font face="helvetica" size="+1" color="#004080">
                The _LF_ meta file article format is 
                simple but powerful and flexible. 
              </font>
            </center>
          </td>
        </tr>
      </table>

<P>A number of different possibilities exist for the definition of such
a meta file format. Here are some possibilities:</P>
<UL>
<LI>use a plain text file
<LI>use html and put the extra information like abstract, about the author, category etc ... into an extra text file.
<LI>use xml
<LI>use M4
<LI>....
</UL>
<P>All these possibilities are valid alternatives but we wanted something
for _LF_ that is self contained (all information in one file), easy
to use and well known to everybody.</P>
<P>The _LF_ article meta file format is plain HTML but with a special
structure. The format is such that it can be viewed with any browser (no
special tags) and is very simple (no nested constructs).</P>

<H2>When should I use this meta file format?</H2>
<p>
The _LF_ HTML meta file format is the official format since June 1999. 
Every article
is internally handled in that format. It is the file format used during
translation of the articles. All articles must be written in that format.
It is only before publishing that they get converted. The program lfparser
(<a href="http://main.linuxfocus.org/~guido/dev/lfparser.html">
http://main.linuxfocus.org/~guido/Guido/lfparser.html</a>)
is used to check and convert an article form the meta file format into 
the final format. </P>

<H2>How does the file meta file format look like?</H2>
The _LF_ HTML meta file format is plain html but starts with a number
of headings with clearly defined order and heading level. 
<OL>
<LI>title of the article on heading level 1
<LI>ArticleCategory on heading level 4 followed by one of the valid
_LF_ article <A HREF="#categories0">categories</a>. The lfparser program will also tell you what the
categories are if you get them wrong.
<LI>AuthorImage on heading level 4 followed by a <tt>&lt;IMG SRC...&gt;</tt>
tag with an image of the author.
<LI>TranslationInfo on heading level 4 with the following syntax:
<br>
<font size=2><pre>&lt;H4&gt;TranslationInfo:[Author and translation history]&lt;/H4&gt;
&lt;P&gt;original in en &lt;A HREF="mailto:joe@joe.org"&gt;Joe Templatewriter&lt;/A&gt; &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;en to es &lt;A HREF="mailto:joe2@joe.org"&gt;Joe Translator&lt;/A&gt; &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;de to es &lt;A HREF="mailto:jim@jim.com"&gt;Jim Jimmy&lt;/A&gt; &lt;/P&gt;</pre></font>
<br>
Please note that the &quot;original in&quot; and the &quot;to&quot;
must not be translated. The de, es, fr, cn, nl, ... are the different
languages as known from domain names according to ISO-standard 3166.
<LI>AboutTheAuthor on heading level 4 followed by a short biography about
the author.
<LI>Abstract on heading level 4 followed an abstract of the article.
The abstract is just a normal html paragraph.
<LI>ArticleIllustration on heading level 4 followed by a <tt>&lt;IMG SRC...&gt;</tt> tag with a title page image for the article.
<LI>ArticleBody on heading level 4. After this tag the actual article comes
as a normal html article. You should arrange your chapter headings
on H2 or H3 heading level. This will make it possible to generate the index
automatically. <B>Please note that the heading tags &lt;H2&gt;, &lt;H3&gt; may not contain any other tags like &lt;FONT...&gt; etc...</B>
<li>
An additional feature of the lfparser is that you can write anywhere
in the article body &#95;LF&#95; and it will expand to LinuxFocus in
the final article.
</OL>
<p>As you see it is a number of simple heading and the actual article body
is just plain html. You can write there what ever you want. For you as an
author of an article the meta file format is much easier to use than
the final article structure as it does not have any complex tables and
nested structures.</p>

<A NAME="categories0">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>What article categories are available?</H2>
<p>
Under the keyword &lt;H4&gt;ArticleCategory:&lt;/H4&gt; you say to which
category your article belongs.<br>
The ArticleCategory can have one of the following values:<br>
<table>
 <tr><TD><ul>
 <li>Forum
 <li>Applications
 <li>Hardware
 <li>Webdesign
 <li>System Administration
 </ul>
 </td>
 <Td>
 <ul>
 <li>Software Development
 <li>Graphics,
 <li>UNIX Basics
 <li>Kernel Corner
 <li>Interviews
 <li>Community
 </ul>
 </TD>
 </TR>
 </TABLE>
</p>


<H2>Software and Tools</H2>
A perl program called lfparser exists to check and convert a _LF_ meta format
article into the final format. You should run this program every time
when you write, translate or updated an article. You can think of 
lfparser as a compiler that takes meta file html articles as input
and produces the final article.
<P>lfparser can be down loaded free from 
<a href="http://www.linuxfocus.org/~guido/dev/lfparser.html">
http://www.linuxfocus.org/developer/~guido/dev/lfparser.html</a></P>
<P>As the author of an article you can also get templates from the
above link.</P>
<p>To run lfparser you need only a working installation of perl 5.004
or higher. Perl is included in every distribution of Linux&reg;. Therefore
you just unpack the tar archive in which lfparser is delivered 
(<tt>tar zxvf lfparser-X.Y.tar.gz</tt>)
and you can use it right away.</p>
