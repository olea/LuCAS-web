    <h1>Kino Terminology</h1>

    <p>You will find the following terminology used throughout the
    documentation and user interface:</p>

    <dl>
      <dt>Movie</dt>

      <dd>A movie is your current project within Kino. Sometimes,
      it is referred to as a "playlist." Kino saves movies as <a
      href="http://www.w3.org/AudioVideo/">SMIL</a> XML&#151;a W3C
      XML standard. We suggest that you save movies with a ".smil"
      filename extension.<br>
      <br>
       Note: Playlist is a deprecated term. That term applied well
      to the old file format, but the new file format is SMIL. SMIL
      is much more sophisticated than the term "playlist" implies.
      As Kino implements more functionality, the deprecated nature
      of the term "playlist" becomes more obvious.</dd>

      <dt>Scene</dt>

      <dd>A scene is a continuous sequence of frames. The old,
      deprecated term is "sequence." A movie is a collection of
      scenes. In capture mode, a scene refers to a segment on tape
      between index points.</dd>

      <dt>Mode/Page</dt>

      <dd>A mode refers to two things in Kino, depending upon
      context. For one, based upon the vi analogy, mode refers to
      the keyboard command context: normal or "ex." Secondly, more
      commonly a mode refers to one of Kino's major functions, and
      the Kino user interface uses a notebook widget with pages for
      each mode. Sometimes, a mode is also called a "page," as in
      the "capture page." Unlike vi, though, when you press 'i' to
      enter input mode, you actually switch to Kino's capture mode.
      And since Kino does not capture characters, it uses the same
      set of keyboard commands that the edit mode uses for
      navigation. See the <a href="commands.html">Command
      Reference</a> for more information.</dd>

      <dt>Frame Dropping</dt>

      <dd>A video playback technique that reduces the video
      framerate to improve audio quality and maintain an overall
      rate of playback that is close to the true audio/video
      framerate. NTSC = approx. 29.97 frames per second. PAL = 25
      frames per second.</dd>

      <dt>Time Code</dt>

      <dd>A display of the running time of video that is
      frame-accurate yet easier for humans to understand than pure
      frame count. It shows hours, minutes, seconds, and frames in
      the format HH:MM:SS:FF.</dd>

      <dt>Drop Frame</dt>

      <dd>Drop frame is a timecode adjustment that applies to NTSC
      video only. Due to the framerate of NTSC, a system that
      normally outputs 30 frames per second must adjust timecode by
      subtracting two frames every minute except every tenth minute
      to achieve the effective framerate. Kino does not currently
      perform any drop frame adjustment; perhaps soon it will.</dd>

      <dt>AutoSplit</dt>

      <dd>AutoSplit is an alogorithm that detects scene changes.
      When AutoSplit is enabled in capture, a new file is created.
      When loading a video clip, AutoSplit examines timecode to
      look for scene breaks. Nice, eh?</dd>

      <dt>Dropped Frames</dt>

      <dd>Dropped frames are frames that are lost during capture.
      Try not to do anything else on your computer while capturing
      to minimize dropped frames. In preferences, you can disable
      the preview during capture to help slower systems. One
      developer hacks on Kino using an AMD K6-2 333MHz machine to
      ensure that Kino is capable of reliable performance on lower
      end machines. If you have dropped frames and not enabled
      AutoSplit during capture, then when you load the video into
      Kino, the AutoSplit algorithm should detect it and Kino
      displays a scene break.</dd>

      <dt>Fields and Interlacing</dt>

      <dd>Every frame of non-progressive scan video is composed of
      two interleaved fields. The result is either 50 fields per
      second for PAL or roughly 60 fields per second for NTSC.
      Interleaving means that all of the even lines are in one
      field, and all of the odd lines are in another field. The
      terms "even" and "odd" field are only useful for illustration
      purposes. These terms, however, are not accurate when
      discussing field order. Rather, it is best to specify "upper"
      or "lower" field first when specifying field order. DV is
      lower-field first.</dd>

      <dt>Inter-field motion</dt>

      <dd>Due to the field-based nature of interlaced video, motion
      in the subjects of the video may result in two different
      pictures. This is a good and bad thing. On the positive side,
      the playback is smoother. The negative side-effect is that
      individual frames of video resulting in a "comb" or "venetian
      blinds" effect leading some viewers to believe the image is
      blurred or just plain "wrong." Applying most image processing
      effects to interleaved pictures produces disastrous results.
      GIMP provides a de-interlace filter that may improve the
      quality of your still frames.</dd>

      <dt>Aspect Ratio</dt>

      <dd>There are two kinds of aspect ratio: frame aspect ratio
      and pixel aspect ratio. Frame aspect ratio is the proportion
      of width and height of a picture typically expressed given a
      square pixel aspect ratio. Most video is 4:3, but 16:9 is
      becoming increasingly popular. Kino currently only supports
      4:3. A 640 pixels wide by 480 pixels high image has a 4:3
      frame aspect ratio. However, the 4:3 DV frame aspect ratio is
      either 720x480 (NTSC) or 720x576 (PAL). Therefore, DV pixels
      are NOT square whereas most computer display resolutions use
      square pixels. Using the XVideo display method, Kino blindly
      assumes you are using a square pixel display resolution and
      compensates for the differences in pixel aspect ratio to
      achieve a better looking preview. However. Kino still capture
      and still frames export functions do not compensate for pixel
      aspect ratio. Therefore, you should scale (resample) the
      image in your image editor (e.g. GIMP) before using it. You
      can scale to any size by simply using a calculator. If you
      know, the height you want multiply it by (4/3) to get the
      width. If you know the width you want, multiply by (3/4) to
      get the height. Then, simply force the scale function into
      those sizes. You might have to tell the image editor to
      unlock the aspect ratio of the picture.</dd>

      <dt>Scrub Bar/Transport Controls/Shuttle</dt>

      <dd>See <a href="ui.html">User Interface</a>.</dd>

      <dt>USB Jog/Shuttle device</dt>

      <dd>A specialized input controller for video editing. It
      consists of a wheel with a ring around it. The wheel actually
      more closely resembles a dial and provides bi-directional,
      very fine, frame-based navigation. The shuttle ring wraps
      around the wheel, and it is spring loaded such that when when
      released it "snaps" back to the center position. The shuttle
      provides bi-directional, variable speed playback including
      fast, normal, and slow speeds. Often, a video deck that
      supports these commands calls this a "trick play" mode.
      Usually, these devices also contain additional programmable
      buttons typically mapped to editing commands. Kino supports
      two USB Jog/Shuttle control devices both in the edit and
      capture modes. In capture mode, Kino supports the IEEE-1394
      AV/C commands required to control your camera or deck's
      transport mechanism. Cool, huh?</dd>
