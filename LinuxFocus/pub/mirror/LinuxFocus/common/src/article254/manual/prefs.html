    <h1>Kino Preferences</h1>

    <h2>Capture</h2>

    <dl>
      <dt>Base File Name</dt>

      <dd>Enter the path where you want to store captured video
      followed by a file name stem. Do not add the extension. Kino
      generates a sequence number and optionally a timestamp that
      it appends to the stem file name. It also generates the file
      extension, currently only .avi.</dd>

      <dt>File Type</dt>

      <dd>Currently, Kino only supports DV AVI file formats. You
      can choose between standard DV1 or DV2 formats. DV2 is more
      compatible with other applications because it creates a
      separate interleaved audio stream. However, if you are only
      capturing for Kino use or for another program that supports
      DV1, then choose it because DV natively interleaves audio
      with the video and the audio stream in DV2 is wasteful.
      MPlayer and Avifile only playback DV2 AVI. Current versions
      of Windows DirectShow do support DV1, but Windows application
      support for DV1 is inconsistent.</dd>

      <dt>Auto Split Files</dt>

      <dd>Generate a new file whenever Kino detects a new scene
      while capturing video.</dd>

      <dt>Put Timestamp In File Name</dt>

      <dd>If enabled, during capture, Kino appends a date and time
      to the base file name specified above.</dd>

      <dt>Frames per File</dt>

      <dd>Set the maximum number of frames a single AVI is to
      contain. While Kino has recently added support for reading
      large files, it does not support writing large files. The
      default is 7000 frames, which should be safe for PAL DV2
      files. An NTSC DV1 file can hold 9000 frames.</dd>

      <dt>Write Every n Frame</dt>

      <dd>This is time-lapse record function. If entered, Kino
      skips n frames between capturing a single frame and adding it
      to the AVI.</dd>

      <dt>Max File Size</dt>

      <dd>Not yet implemented.</dd>
    </dl>

    <h2>IEEE 1394</h2>

    <dl>
      <dt>IEEE 1394 Interface</dt>

      <dd>This provides support for multiple IEEE 1394 host
      adapters, NOT the individual ports on a single adapter.
      Nothing needs to be done to address a port on a single
      adapater, as 1394 automatically takes care of this. This is a
      zero-based number.</dd>

      <dt>IEEE 1394 Channel</dt>

      <dd>This provides support for selecting an isochronous
      channel for capture and export. The default is 63 because
      that is the broadcast channel. All other channels are for
      point-to-point communication. Only advanced users would ever
      need this.</dd>

      <dt>VCR (AV/C) Control</dt>

      <dd>Kino detects all cameras on the bus that support the AV/C
      command set. Select one from the list. It attempts to read
      the name of the device from its Configuration ROM, but not
      all devices implement it. If the name is not readable, then
      the numeric node is used. Most users only have one AV/C
      device connected anyway. You do not need a camera supporting
      AV/C to capture video! It is only used to control the tape
      transport mechansim.</dd>

      <dt>DV Export/Timing</dt>

      <dd>
        These two timing entry fields let you tweak the parameters
        of the DV export algorithm to achieve successful results. A
        value of 0 for either field selects its built-in default,
        which has been deemed compatible for most users based upon
        current feedback. However, if you need to adjust them, then
        it helps to know the built-in values to use as a starting
        point for experimentation: 

        <table border="1">
          <tr>
            <th>Setting</th>

            <th>PAL</th>

            <th>NTSC</th>
          </tr>

          <tr>
            <td>Increment</td>

            <td>1</td>

            <td>2436</td>
          </tr>

          <tr>
            <td>Threshold</td>

            <td>16</td>

            <td>38400</td>
          </tr>
        </table>
      </dd>

      <dt>DV Export/SYT Offset</dt>

      <dd>video1394 must generate a timestamp in DV transmission
      stream that must be a fairly precise offset of the bus'
      master cycle timer. This can vary on systems due to latency
      or device compatibility. Values between 18000 and 20000 seem
      to work for most users.</dd>
    </dl>

    <h2>Display</h2>

    <dl>
      <dt>Display Method</dt>

      <dd><b>GDK:</b> very compatible with X servers and the X
      Windows client/server architecture. Not very fast. Does not
      maintain frame aspect ratio.<br>
       <b>XVideo (Xv)</b>: requires XFree86 4.x and supporting
      hardware and X server. Run 'xvinfo' from the shell to get
      information about support on your system. Very fast and Kino
      maintains both frame and pixel-accurate aspect ratio. You can
      not take a screen capture of the video preview in this mode.
      XVideo is similar to Microsoft DirectDraw.<br>
       <b>Reduce Xv</b>: Similar to XVideo above with the same
      advantages and disadvantages. This variation, however, uses
      half of the data bandwidth that is needed for compatibility
      on some X servers and hardware. The reduction in data
      bandwidth does invoke a scaling CPU overhead thereby
      affecting performance.</dd>

      <dt>Enable preview during capture</dt>

      <dd>To reduce the chance of dropped frames during video
      capture to disk, disable this option. If you have a fast
      enough system, you can turn this om and get a live preview of
      the video being captured.</dd>

      <dt>Drop video frames as needed</dt>

      <dd>When enabled, Kino uses sophisticated algorithms and
      threads to sacrifice the video frame rate in order to provide
      better audio quality of play back and to provide an overall
      playback rate that is consistent and true with time.
      Basically, only disable this if you are interested in seeing
      if you machine is fast enough to decode DV in realtime. If
      you machine is not fast enough, then your will hear audio
      clicks and gaps.</dd>

      <dt>DV decode quality</dt>

      <dd>You can adjust the quality of the DV decoder to reduce
      the processing overhead for increased playback performance.
      This does not affect the quality of DV exported over IEEE
      1394 back into your camera.</dd>
    </dl>

    <h2>Audio</h2>

    <p>You can enable or disable audio and set the OSS device file
    to use for your machine. Kino only supports OSS at this time.
    If you are running a sound server in your desktop environment
    such as esd for GNOME, or aRts for KDE, then Kino cannot open
    the sound device unless your driver explicitly supports it. The
    SoundBlaster Live series cards and driver support multiple
    opens.</p>

    <h2>Jog/Shuttle</h2>

    <p>Enable this if you have a Contour Shuttle Pro or Sony USB
    Jog/Shuttle controller. See the README_jogshuttle to build the
    kernel module and its dependent modules.</p>

    <h2>Other</h2>

    <dl>
      <dt>Disable Key Repeat</dt>

      <dd>If you find that your keystrokes are buffering and you
      inadvertently have to wait for Kino to process all of them,
      then you might enable this option. If enabled, Kino only
      operates on the oldest event in the queue and discards all
      pending events. On the other hand, enabling this option may
      require you to use the keys more slowly in order for Kino to
      receive the ones you do intend it to process.</dd>

      <dt>Enable time code display on startup</dt>

      <dd>By default the video clip timestamp and timecode display
      is turned off for performance reasons. You can click the
      timecode field labels in the main window to turn them on, but
      Kino does not automatically remember that. Enable this option
      to make Kino always start with the timecode display
      active.</dd>
