NAME
       kino - non-linear editing of Digital Video data

SYNOPSIS
       kino [ ( file | playlist ) ... ]

DESCRIPTION
       kino  allows  you  to import movies from DV camcorders, to
       edit, and play them.  file may be a DV coded AVI file that
       will  be loaded at startup. Alternatively, you can specify
       a playlist of AVI files that was previously  created  with
       kino.

KEYSTROKES
       Unlike other editors, kino uses many keyboard commands for
       fast navigation and editing inside the movie.  It acts  on
       frames that are single images from a movie, sequences that
       are defined as  groupings  of  one  or  more  frames  with
       recording  times differing by no more than one second, and
       movies that are groups of one or more sequences. The  fol­
       lowing keystrokes can be used for moving and editing. Some
       of them are also available as buttons in a graphical  menu
       bar.  (Also  note the deliberate similarities between kino
       commands and the text editor vi.)
