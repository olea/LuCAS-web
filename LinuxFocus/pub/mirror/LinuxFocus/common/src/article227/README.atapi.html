X-CD-Roast 0.98alpha9
----------------------

This file lists specific instructions how to easily setup
SCSI-Emulation needed for X-CD-Roast to access ATAPI-cdwriters.
(Linux only)

A general text about this topic is the CD-Writing-HOWTO
by Winfried Truemper (http://www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/CD-Writing-HOWTO.html).

In most recent distributions it is however much easier to setup
SCSI-Emulation as described in the HOWTO.
(You should NEVER need to compile your kernel!)

This is of course not complete and should become much more detailed in
the future. Please provide me with updates.


Instructions for RedHat 7 / Mandrake 7.2:
-----------------------------------------
(may also work fine on all other distributions of Linux)


Your CD-Writer is recognized by the kernel at boot up and is assigned
an ATAPI-device name like /dev/hdc. 

Look in the boot-up messages for a text like that:

kernel:     ide0: BM-DMA at 0xd000-0xd007, BIOS settings: hda:DMA, hdb:pio
kernel:     ide1: BM-DMA at 0xd008-0xd00f, BIOS settings: hdc:DMA, hdd:pio
kernel: hda: IBM-DTLA-307030, ATA DISK drive
kernel: hdc: GENERIC CRD-BP1300P, ATAPI CDROM drive

Here you see -&gt; hdc is my writer (Its usually detected as CDROM-drive). 
Add /dev/ to it and that is the information we need to continue.

Add a line to your /etc/lilo.conf:

	append="hdc=ide-scsi"

NOTE: If you have more as one CD-ROM/Writer the line to use is like this:
	
	append="hdc=ide-scsi hdd=ide-scsi"

(restart lilo after this by simply typing "lilo")

Add this to your /etc/modules.conf:

	options ide-cd ignore=hdc
	pre-install sg modprobe ide-scsi

NOTE: If you have more as one CD-ROM/Writer the lines to use are like this:

	options ide-cd ignore='hdc hdd'
	pre-install sg modprobe ide-scsi


After a reboot your cdwriter should be displayed by "cdrecord -scanbus"

	1,0,0	100) 'GENERIC ' 'CRD-BP1300P     ' 'ah26' Removable CD-ROM

If this does not work, try to load the emulation-module manually:

	/sbin/insmod ide-scsi

If now "cdrecord -scanbus" displays your writer, consider to add that
insmod-call to the end of your /etc/rc.local-file.
Otherwise something has gone wrong. Please consult the CD-Writing HOWTO
for further information.

Now xcdroast is fully operational - but its perhaps nice to change the
link /dev/cdrom from /dev/hdc to /dev/scd0. (Look also into /etc/fstab
to remove all reverences to /dev/hdc). 

Note: This procedure does NOT require any kernel-compilation and is easily
      reversible. It's very possible that this works exactly for other
      distributions. Please tell me...


Advanced Notes:

Multiple SCSI Devices: For systems with more than one SCSI controller 
(including the usage of ide-scsi) there must be a line in 
conf.modules for each SCSI controller. For example, if the first 
is an Adaptec 2940 dual channel (aic7xxx) and the second is an
IDE Zip drive, conf.modules should have the following entries:


	alias scsi_hostadapter aic7xxx
	alias scsi_hostadapter1 aic7xxx
	alias scsi_hostadapter2 ide-scsi
