   <dt><a href="install.en.html">Installation Manual</a>
    - Installation instructions for the Debian GNU/Linux system.

   <dd><p>Please read this before you begin, especially if you are
     new to Linux.  These manuals are designed to get you started
     quickly by explaining things you could not possibly already know
     without previous experience with Linux and with the Debian
     GNU/Linux distribution.  It will save you hours of frustration if
     you begin here and patiently read the fine manual from cover to
     cover.</p>

    <p>Also available in <a href="install.en.pdf">PDF</a> and ascii
     <a href="install.en.txt">text</a>.</p>

   <dt>The <a href="cfdisk.txt"><tt>cfdisk</tt></a> and
    <a href="fdisk.txt"><tt>fdisk</tt></a> manuals.

   <dd><p>These explain how to use the Linux <tt>cfdisk</tt> and
     <tt>fdisk</tt> disk partitioning software.  The installer program
     will start <tt>cfdisk</tt> for you if you need to repartition
     your disk.  You will only need <tt>fdisk</tt> if <tt>cfdisk</tt>
     doesn't work for some reason.</p>


   <dt><a href="release-notes.en.html">Release Notes</a>

   <dd><p>What has changed since Debian 2.1, and some information on upgrading to 2.2</p>

   <dt><a href="dselect-beginner.en.html"><b><tt>dselect</tt></b> Beginner's Guide</a>
    - Software package management tool instructions.

   <dd><p><tt>dselect</tt> is a tool used for selecting and deselecting
     which software packages you would like to have installed on your
     computer.  It takes a little bit of fore-knowledge to use it
     confidently the first time you encounter it face to face.  This
     is recommended reading.</p>

    <p>Also available in <a href="dselect-beginner.pdf">PDF</a> and ascii
     <a href="dselect-beginner.txt">text</a>.</p>

   <dt><a href="http://www.debian.org/doc/">Online documentation</a> available at www.debian.org.
    
   <dd><p>Here you will find World Wide Web links to more infomation than
     will fit on a CD-ROM.  It's more than anyone can read in a month!</p>
