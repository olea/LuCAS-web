1.01.00 --General
 
1.01.01
SUBJECT: What is the purpose of this FAQ?

  This FAQ is to serve as a guide to the resources known to
  be available for helping you to understand SNMP, SNMPv2,
  and their related technologies.  OSI/CMIP is touched on
  briefly as well because we're fair-minded folk.
 
  There is NO INTENT that this be a one-stop SNMP tutorial.
  There is NO INFERENCE that this is an authoritative or
  official document of any kind. What you see is what you get.
 
  You WILL need to read the books listed herein, maybe even
  some of the RFCs.  You may wish to take a class as well.
  Just think of this as your "tourist guide book."

SUBJECT: This FAQ Stinks!

A concerned reader writes:

"The SNMP FAQ contains incorrect sometimes outdated information and
it might therefore cause more questions than it answers. What is
your policy with regard to corrections? It sometimes looks that you
are just adding corrections and not removing the incorrect text.
This makes the FAQ difficult to use and it keeps incorrect stuff
around, which again causes confusion."

"There is also an issue with relationship to other documents. For
example, the SimpleTimes contains an up-to-date list of RFCs related
to SNMP. The FAQ contains several more or less correct and outdated
lists. I think it would be useful in cases like this to just refer
to a `reliable' source instead of trying to include information which
is not maintained."

Editor's note: Our concerned reader is perceptive. We rely on the good
will and support of our readers to notice omissions, commissions and
deprecations in the FAQ, although we do try and update RFC lists from
time to time. We will act on any notice from you that something ought
to be changed. Please send me your corrections.

URLs change often and we don't have the time to check them routinely.
We also publish the large personal collections of several contributors,
some of which offer conflicting details. That's the way it is with
tribal documents such as this. If any error in this FAQ causes you to
waste or loose precious time then you probably expected too much to
begin with. Please use it with our good wishes and this disclaimer.

A good overview of SNMP can be found at:

http://www.ddri.com/Doc

You'll find a 30-page article that provides a high-level but detailed overview
of SNMP, including philosophy, applications, protocol description, useful MIB
objects, and a description of ASN.1 syntax.

This should get you started.

1.10.02
SUBJECT: How do I develop and use SNMP technology?

To deploy and use SNMP technology for management involves
many steps.
If you are a device vendor you need to:
1) decide what aspects of your products you want to
   be managable via SNMP
2) select the standard MIBs to implement (and the objects/traps
   within them to implement)
3) create proprietary MIB modules containing objects and traps
   for the management areas not covered by standard MIBs
4) Select an SNMP agent toolkit vendor
5) put instrumentation in your devices
6) following the directions from the SNMP toolkit vendor, create
   access routines (which some SNMP toolkit vendors call method
   routines) to get and set the values of from your instrumentation
7) Select an SNMP agent test package, and test your agent
8) Select an SNMP management API library
9) Write SNMP applications to manage your device

If you are an end-user, you need to:
1) determine what SNMP management capability that you have
   in your current devices
2) determine the SNMP management capability that is available
   in similar devices from other vendors (in case you need to
   upgrade or change)
3) determine what you want to accomplish with management
4) find off the self management packages that provide the
   management functions you want
5) possibly upgrade or replace your current devices with one
   that are managable with the package you chose.
6) implement additional management functions using scripting
7) implement additional management functions using custom written
   code using a purchased off the self SNMP management API library
8) configure your agents and applications to talk to each other.

1.10.10
SUBJECT: How does an Agent know where to send a Trap?


I've noticed on the comp.protocols.snmp mailing list that the question
"how does an agent know where to send traps" (short answer is "its
implementation specific", long answer is, indeed, long, but has been
well answered numerous times) is, indeed, a Frequently Asked Question.
Any chance of adding it to your quite impressive FAQ posting?

T. Max Devlin

[Editor's Note: What T. Max is getting at here is that the trap
 destination IP address is not represented in MIB-II, so how can
 the agent know what it is? The answer is that most agents require
 an external configuration process to take place before they can
 be put into service, and that is how the IP address, among other
 interesting parameters, is set in the agent. How this setup is
 actually done varies among agent developers.]

1.10.15
SUBJECT: How can I remotely manage community strings?

Because the methodology for setting community strings is not
standardized, every type of device/agent version may have a
different mechanism for handling this chore.  Therefore, there
are no "single console" products for setting community strings.
For this to be feasible, you would have to be able to
differentiate every agent type, and know how that particular
vendor/system/agent handles it.

1.11.00 --RFC

1.11.01
SUBJECT: What is an RFC?

  The letters stand for the title Request For Comment, which
  is the initial stage in the process for creating Internet
  standards.  RFCs go through several stages of review and
  refinement before they are adopted as final by the Internet
  community.
 
1.11.02
SUBJECT: Where can I get RFC text?

1.11.02.01

On WWW:
-------

Ohio State University has an extensive set of RFCs in html (browser)
format.  To see RFC 9898 (for example), use the following URL:

http://www.cis.ohio-state.edu/htbin/rfc/rfc9898.html
                                        ^^^^^^^
                           Put actual RFC number here.

Simply change the RFC number in the above URL to access the correct
file for your purpose.

RFC-Info Simplified Help      submitted by: Mark Wallace
-----
 
Use RFC-Info by sending an email messages to RFC-INFO@ISI.EDU.
 
1.  To get a specific RFC send a message with text as follows:
 
        Retrieve: RFC   
          Doc-ID: RFC1500
 
This gets RFC 1500.  All RFC numbers in the Doc-Id are 4 digits 
(RFC 791 would be Doc-ID: RFC0791).
 
2.  To get a specific FYI send a message with text as follows:
 
        Retrieve: FYI
          Doc-ID: FYI0004
 
3.  To get a list of available RFC's that match a certain criteria:
 
        LIST: RFC
    Keywords: Gateway
 
Returns a list of RFC's with the word Gateway in the title or
specified as a keyword.

SNMP Archives summary. Maintained by Bruce Barnett

"The following are FTP/WEB sites for various packages, information, etc.
I have not used many of these tools, but do try to keep a record of 
locations. They are in no particular order.

	OSIMIS-4.0 is now ready and as already mentioned it is available
	free of charge on a non-commercial basis to all institutions.
	Institutions wishing to obtain it should sign a non-commercial
	licence. The exact procedure is as follows:

	a. send a request to osimis-licence@cs.ucl.ac.uk (NOT to this list)
	b. a soft copy of the licence will be sent to you by e-mail
	c. a signed hard copy of the licence should be sent to UCL by snail-mail
	d. as soon as the latter is received, information on FTAM/FTP access
 	   to an encrypted copy and the required decryption key will be 
         sent to you

	OSIMIS-4.0 is substantially enhanced compared to version 3.0
	and has been developed by the RACE ICM and MIDAS projects. A
	description is accessible through WWW:


	From the features described there, conditional packages are not
	yet properly supported. In short, new developments include:
	
	- a GDMO compiler and an enhanced "plug-in" MO API
	- a high level manager access API (RMIB)
	- object and state management, alarm reporting and metric objects
	- standard event reporting and logging
	- security extensions (authentication and integrity checking)
	- location transparency / discovery service using the OSI directory
	- a full CMIS/P-SNMP generic proxy facility conforming to the 
	  NMF IIMC work
	- a facility to allow management systems to work transparently
	  over simulated network/services
	- various performance/size optimisations
	- interoperability / conformance and many other fixes
	
	OSIMIS-4.0 needs ISODE-7.0, 8.0 or the ISODE Consortium R1.0
	and can be built using the GNU C++ 2.5.8 and earlier versions
	or the ATT 2.1.  A pre-built version (binaries) for Sun SPARC /
	SunOS 4.1.3 built with gcc/g++ 2.5.8 is also available.
	Operating systems supported are SunOS (not Solaris), AIX and
	HP-UX.
	
	There is no new users' manual but enough documentation
	to enable people to use the new features / convert old code.
	Bear in mind that there is NO time/resources to answer support-type
	questions, please refrain from asking.

Re: perl & SNMP
	There are two solutions: one requires patches to perl, 
	the other (Tricklet, see above) uses an external program.
	Contact gmstreet@guy.b30.ingr.com for information on his 
	extension/patches to perl for SNMP. It might be available via FTP on
	liasun3.epfl.ch:/pub/net/snmp/snmpperl*

The next step is to get all the back issues of The Simple Times.  For
more information on this informative, free publication, send a message
to st-subscriptions@simple-times.org with a subject of "help"

There is also an online publication dealing with CMIP called CMIP Run.
Backissues are available on the host ibmstandards.cary.ibm.com (192.35.236.4)
in the directory /pub/protocols/mgmt/cmip/cmip_run, and subscription requests can be sent to
cmiprun@ralvm6.vnet.ibm.com.  (there are two list, a notification list
to tell you when a new issue is available on the ftp site, and a mail list
to which new issues are actually sent).

There are also several books on the subject, including Rose's "The Simple
Book 2nd Ed." and Stallings' "SNMP, SNMPv2, and CMIP"

SUBJECT: SNMP and Autodiscovery

1.13.01.01

"Automated topology discovery is a hard problem due to the diversity of deployed
systems and the wide distribution of resource information.  I will briefly
mention some reasons why a ping/traceroute based approach will not work :
subnetting, tunneling, firewalls, virtual LANS.  Your network topology
discovery tool would have to extract more information like subnet masks,

"[...]these are some of the methods that I had used

1. SNMP Broadcast on your local net; all SNMP agents respond
2. Listening for RIP, and OSPF ports, you'll get info on the routers around,
and consequently the different sub-networks connected by this router. If you
need a better discovery you could listen on both IP and IPX ports.
3. ICMP Router interface discovery; this will again give you information on
all the router interfaces (sub-nets)
4. Once you know a sub-net and it's mask (I'm speaking about IP nets) you
could issue an ICMP-echo spray to all the possible IP addresses in that
range, the one's who are alive will respond. But this has to be fine tuned
so that you do not swamp the network with disocvery packets. In case of IPX
you issue an IPX diagnostic message spray (the counterpart of ICMP in Novell
networks).
5. You could walk the routing tables (MIB2) and get information about other
routers and sub-nets. You could figure out the type of the sub-net (MAC
layer) by looking up "ifType" for each of the router interfaces.

NOTE: The typical problems you would face is handling unnumbered router
ports, and proxy-ARP issues."

SUBJECT: SNMP Traps

I am relatively ignorant about SNMP. However, I have spent a
reasonable amount of effort investigating agents, managers, the
technology, and I have read most of the important RFC's.

There are a bunch of related but simple, practical questions to which
I cannot get a straight answer: Are SNMP traps useful in the real
world? Can you depend on traps being sent across networks? Do agents
repeat traps? How do you select a polling interval if there are traps
you consider very important?

RFC 1215 (the one with the TRAP-TYPE macro) says traps are a bad idea
(well, sort of). RFC 1224 seems to describe a method to acknowledge
SNMP traps and throttle them?

What's the real feeling...you know, in practice? The real state of the
art?

Shyamal Prasad

Traps are very useful to us. They let us know when a router link goes down,
when network performance is degrading, when a power failure has occurred,
etc. - just to name a few.

You don't poll for traps - the agent just sends the traps to the network
management station(s) you tell it to send them to. Now you can program the
network management station to take automatic action if you so desire. For
example, if one of our ethernet concentrators sends us traps on a
misbehaving port we automatically do some checking and if it is a situation
that could potentially take our whole segment down we automatically
partition the port off of the network. I'm sure this has saved numerous
network outages.

Yes, agents may send repetitive traps. The way you throttle or deal with
them depends on the software you use on your network management station.

All that said - you cannot rely on traps alone. For example, if I die - I
cannot pick up the phone and tell someone that "I am dead". Neither can a
SNMP agent. Therefore it is good to poll the agents periodically just to see
if they are alive and well.

1.20.00 --General Questions about SNMPv2

1.20.01
SUBJECT: What is SNMPv2?

 
   SNMPv2 is a revised protocol (not just a new MIB)
   which includes improvements to SNMP in the areas
   of performance, security, confidentiality, and
   manager-to-manager communications.
 
        
   SNMPv2 Framework :
   The following RFC's identify the major components of SNMPv2.

   Historical
   ----------
 
   RFC 1441 - Introduction to SNMP v2
   RFC 1442 - SMI For SNMP v2
   RFC 1443 - Textual Conventions for SNMP v2
   RFC 1444 - Conformance Statements for SNMP v2
   RFC 1445 - Administrative Model for SNMP v2
   RFC 1446 - Security Protocols for SNMP v2
   RFC 1447 - Party MIB for SNMP v2
   RFC 1448 - Protocol Operations for SNMP v2
   RFC 1449 - Transoport Mappings for SNMP v2
   RFC 1450 - MIB for SNMP v2
   RFC 1451 - Manager to Manger MIB
   RFC 1452 - Coexistance between SNMP v1 and SNMP v2

Micha Kushner adds:

RFC Number   Title                                   Status

RFC 1908     Coexistence between SNMPv1 and SNMPv2   Draft Standard

Wes Hardaker adds:

"All SNMPv2 versions but one are historical.  Only SNMPv2c is
experimental, but is widely accepted as the SNMPv2 standard.  Note
that the other pieces of SNMPv2 (protocol, SMI, etc) are on the
standards track.  Only the architecture that ties them together is
experimental.  The SNMPv2 messaging protocol, etc, are referenced in
the SNMPv3 documents, which are on the standards track at draft
standard right now."


1.20.02
SUBJECT: What is SNMPv2*/SNMPv1+/SNMPv1.5/SNMP++?

 
  SNMPv2 had been announced for many months, and most of us assumed that it was
  accepted as the next step up from SNMPv1. That assumption was false.  In fact there
  were several points on which the members of the IETF subcommittee could not agree.
  Primary among them was the security and administrative needs of the protocol.

  Simply put, SNMPv2*/SNMPv1+/SNMPv1.5 is SNMPv2 without the contentious
  pieces, but *with* the stuff everyone agrees is of value.

  You may wish to check
     http://www.int.snmp.com/v2star.html

1.30.02
SUBJECT: RMON Standardization Status

  RMON is one of the many SNMP based MIBs that are on the IETF
  Standards track (RFC 1310).  Currently (Jan 94) RMON has two

  2.  Chapter 7 in "SNMP, SNMPv2 and CMIP: The Practical Guide to

  Addison-Wesley, goes into some detail on the RMON MIB.

1.30.07
SUBJECT: RMON2

RMON2 is an IETF standards track effort.

The IETF RMON working group started on the RMON2 MIB module
back in the fall of 1994. It was published as RFC 2021 in
January 1997. All of the leading probe vendors, including
NetScout, Technically Elite, Solcom, HP, etc have probes
that support it. Also, many of the networking device manufacturers
including Bay Networks and 3Com have embedded RMON2 support
in their products. 

There was an interoperability test summit in December 1997, which
was attended by all of the companies above plus Cisco and
Cabletron.

The RMON2 specification is quite stable and ready for advancement
in the standards process. Two additions are in the works to be
published. They are RMON extensions for switches and an RMON
extension for fast networks.

The major difference [between RMON and RMON2] is that RMON provided
statistics only at the data link layer, where as RMON2 provides
statistics at the network and upper layers. 

As to the original questions from Paul Black,

It is difficult to take advantange of all the features in RMON
with generic tools. With RMON2, it is even more difficult.

where DELTA(attribute) means the difference of the value

Serial lines (including TDM systems like T1) measure interface
speed as half duplex.  That is, the 1.544 Megabit per second
bandwidth is one way; a full duplex line actually has twice that
value.  1.544 Mb for transmit, 1.544 Mb for receive.  If you want
the "interface utilization", then you would add outOctetcs and
inOctets together, as you did, but use 3088000 for the interface
speed.

If you want "line utilization" (which is more valuable for
typical management operations), you could use the "max" value of
in or out Octets, as in the previous example.  This is more
useful, because the line may be at 50% utilization (using your
method) and still be saturated, if all traffic is going one way.

Make sure your time delta doesn't exceed the wrap time the 32 bit MIB2
counters,  ~6 Hrs for T1.  Its a nice touch if ifInOctets and ifOutOctets are
bound in the same PDUs.  Also bind sysUpTime in each PDU so you can detect
agent reload.

Charlie Dellacona

T1 circuits are duplex, you have to have separate
utilisation formulae for both in and out. Otherwise you run the risk of
missing that your heavily utilised in one direction because the other is
very light. In many configurations this is a likely situation, a short
frame requesting data from a server or mainframe resulting in megabytes
heading in the opposite direction.

Wim Harthoorn

1.50.01.05

To make your figures mean something useful, generate incoming and outgoing 
utilization separately. A T1 link is full-duplex....1.544 Mbps in each
direction. An organizational T1 Internet link will saturate on the incoming 
side while the outgoing side is less than half utilized.  Your formula would 
indicate that the link had some extra bandwidth capability when in reality 
its a major bottleneck.

Gary Flynn

1.50.01.06

You are missing a few subtleties of getting this exactly right.  What
you want to do is sample (all in one packet exchange) the values of
ifInOctets, ifOutOctets, and sysUptime.  Then, you sample all three
again (after some interval) and use the three deltas to compute:

	Delta(ifInOctets)*8
	-- => Input % utilization
	Delta(sysUptime)*154

And likewise for output.  Note that there are two factors of 100
folded into the denominator (that's why 154 instead of 1540000), one
since sysUptime is hundredths of a second and the second to get a
percent rather than a fraction.  You could also fold the 8 and 154
together as well, but that's not an integer...  And be sure your Delta
function properly accounts for wrapping.

You should do this periodically, each time computing the deltas from
the previous sample, dropping intervals that are "insane"
(e.g. sysUptime has a large delta [positive or negative] compared to
the wall [or monitoring system] clock).  You will want to compute
_both_ deltas and plot them over time as well as extracting just the
maximum value.  You want a sampling period that's small enough to
really indicate peaks, without being so short it overloads the
monitoring or monitored systems.  If you can, you want to monitor both
ends of the line (ifOutOctets at one end may be greater than
ifInOctets at the other, in which case it's a better measure of load
in that direction).

Michael A. Patton

Dependent on your need for reproduction and historical tracking of the
utilization and other factors such as error rates, you might want to
consider purchasing a performance monitoring and reporting tool to help
you through some of this.

We have a tool for doing precisely what you want, and it also solves for
cases of counter roll-over and sysuptime resets.  Our tool is called
ClearStats and is very economical and flexible.  We have autodiscover
and automated/scheduled reporting. Check us out at

In the formula, 9.6 is the interpacket gap time in micro seconds.
6.4 is the preamble+start-frame-delimiter time in micro seconds.
Each time you send a packet, these are present.
The 10,000 is the speed. You change this to 100,000 for 100 Mb/s
ethernet.
For full duplex, the formula is the same, but it applies to
each channel. That is, full duplex is a point-to-point technology.
If you connect nodes A and B. There are essentially two dedicated
and contention free channels, one from from A to B and the other
from B to A. You can compute utilization on each channel.

Page 7 of RFC 2358, Definitions of Managed Objects for the Ethernet-like
Interface Types, describes how the ifSpeed object from IF-MIB should be
set for full-duplex ethernet interfaces:

[RFC quote deleted -- go get yourself a copy. Ed.]

So, the answer to your question is that for a full-duplex 10BaseT interface
ifSpeed should be 10Mbps, just as it is for a half-duplex interface.

[Editor's Note: T. Max Devlin's response has been edited to fit.
 These out takes are noted by "[...]".]

Suitable thresholds are environmentally sensitive; everybody's "correct"
values area little different.  The best you will get from products or
info sources are more "defaults" than "best guesses", IMHO.  We've found
that the ideal setting for thresholds does not correlate to absolute
numbers, or even typical ranges. [...]

The best approach, seriously, to thresholding is to consider, not some
absolute concept of the perfect network metrics, but the results of the
thresholding.  Essentially, you should look at a simple plot of your
values over a few hours and a few days (baselining), then pick a
threshold value that will result in an "appropriate" number of alerts.
If you want a log-style "this is how many times this happens", you might
want every peak to trip the threshold.  If a more report-oriented "the
occurrences happened at this time", a slightly higher value might be
called for.  "This is a problem, you should know about it even if you
can't 'fix' it" thresholds might trigger a few times a week, and the
"the network is broken; get busy" alerts should essentially be set high
enough so that they never happen under typical network conditions.

The real issue is not what the numbers should be, but how often you want
to know about it. [...]

But just so I don't leave you high and dry, here's some beginning
defaults, if you insist:

Total errors: <2%
FCS errors: <2%
Alignment errors: <1%
broadcast packets: Start with 10%; bring up if you are flooded, bring
                   down if it never triggers
runts: <1%, but some systems might have much larger values under normal
            conditions
collisions: 10%
undersize and oversize packets: <1%
long and short events: <1%

There are two to-be-published MIBs that may be of interest to you.

The Application Management MIB <draft-ietf-applmib-mib-11.txt> provides
statistics for application or service IO channels. On top of these 
channels, one can have transaction streams with transaction kind 
specific statistics.

The WWW Services MIB <draft-ietf-applmib-wwwmib-11.txt> provides a core
set of statistics for Web services. It is written against an abstract
document transfer protocol. Mappings to FTP and HTTP are defined in the
document.

Both MIBs have been approved by the IESG for publication as Prosposed
Standards. They are currently sitting in the queue of the RFC editor
waiting for publications as RFCs. Both MIBs are the product of the
application management working group.

You should definately look at RFC 2863 which is the latest definition of

ifSpeed should represent an estimate of the bandwidth of the 
interface. ifHighSpeed should be used if ifSpeed isn't 
large enough. 

http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc1573.html

Les Cargill

There seems to be rough consensus on the former interpretation, i.e.,
that the interface can transmit at a rate of 'ifSpeed' in each direction
simultaneously.

There seems to be nearly universal agreement on this interpretation.

In searching the IETF mail archive (specifically 1998-07.mail.aug4)
I found the following two excerpts which might be helpful:
