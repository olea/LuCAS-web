* DESCRIPTION

This package contains the eighth release of the Linux extra man pages in Spanish.
Note it is an alpha release, so you can find a lot of bugs. These man pages
are from several packages and applications. See PAQUETES file for more
information about packages.

This package complements the man-pages-es one.

Much is missing - contributions are welcome. For any doubt or suggestion, or
to collaborate with the project, send an e-mail to the project coordinator:
Juan Piernas Cánovas <piernas@ditec.um.es>.
An archive of the currently available man pages in
Spanish can be found at http://www.ditec.um.es/~piernas/manpages-es/

* INSTALATION

"make install" will just copy them to /usr/man/es/man[1-8],
where man-1.5 will find them if you set LANG=es_ES. (NOTE: some old
distributions will need to set LANG=es).

"make" will move the pages from this package that are older than
the already installed ones to a subdirectory `not_installed',
then remove old versions (compressed or not), and finally copy them
to /usr/man/es/man[1-8].

If your man pager can handle compressed source pages
(man-1.5 can), you might do "make gz" or "make bz2" before "make install",
or just say "make allgz" or "make allbz".

* CONFIGURATION

We must configure our language and man program to see in Spanish man pages
which are translated.

To select Spanish as language, we must add the next line to our
~/.bash_profile file:

        export LANG=es_ES

For man program apropiately displaying acute vowels, "ñ" and other spanish
characters, we must modify its configuration file, maybe /etc/man.config,
and replace the line

        NROFF           /usr/bin/groff -Tascii -mandoc
with
        NROFF           /usr/bin/groff -Tlatin1 -mandoc

and the line

        NEQN            /usr/bin/geqn -Tascii
with
        NEQN            /usr/bin/geqn -Tlatin1


If you use "less" as your pager then make sure the variable
LESSCHARSET=latin1, otherwise your pager will not be able to
handle the spanish character set.

Also, make sure to load a font which is able to handle the spanish character
set executing, for example, 
	/usr/bin/setfont /usr/lib/kbd/consolefonts/lat1u-16.psf
in one of your initialization shell scripts.
