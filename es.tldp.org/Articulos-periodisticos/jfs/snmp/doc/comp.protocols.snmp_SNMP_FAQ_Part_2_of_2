2.00.00 FAQ PART 2 of 2:

2.01.00 --CMIP

2.01.01
SUBJECT: What is CMIP?

   YES, we do need to mention it here!
 
   Paul Rolland writes from France:
 
 "CMIP is the Common Management Information Protocol. It is an OSI
  protocol that has been defined for Network Management. It comes
  together with the CMIS (Commom Management Information Service). 
  This service provides :
    monitoring: in this case, you are using CMIP to gain information,
    control:    you can manipulate objects that you manage,
    reporting:  Managed objects can tell you something wrong is
                happening."
 
2.01.02
SUBJECT: What books should I read about CMIP?

   The collected OSI specifications are of sufficient bulk
   to sink a small craft in calm waters.  Start easy:

SUBJECT: What is OMNIPoint?

   "A common approach to the integrated management of
    networked information systems."
 
   In practical terms, a vehicle for helping to bridge
   the standards gap between SNMP and OSI/CMIP so that
   the end user customer can reap the benefits of both.

2.02.00 --Other Network Management Protocols

2.02.01
SUBJECT: What alternatives exist to SNMP?

2.02.01.01
1) CMIP/GDMO (Common Management Information Protocol/Guidelines for the
Definition of Managed Objects) is an ITU network management protocol.
Requires more resources on client and server to operate than SNMP but
provides a richer and a better object oriented basis than SNMP; still backed
by many telecommunications vendors and carriers but some question its future
now that CORBA has become so popular (see below). Try http://www.itu.int/

2) TL1 (Transaction Language 1) is a Network Element (NE) management
language defined by Telcordia (formerly Bellcore) that is used primarily in
North America in telecommunications equipment. Unlike all the other
protocols I mention here, it is ASCII based and designed to allow text entry
of commands via a "craft" port (EIA232 or X.25 connector) by a machine or
"craftsperson" and responses or autonomous messages to be easily parsed by
machines and read by craftspersons. Try http://www.tl1.com/ or
http://www.telcordia.com/

3) (There is a German NE management protocol that I always forget the name
of; don't know anything about it though.)

[I think you mean QD2, right? It is somehow a light version of Q3.
For more information on QD2, please contact mailto:tssinfo@de.bosch.com

Frank Fock

2.02.01.02
4) CORBA (Common Object Request Broker Architecture) is an object oriented
remote-procedure-call (RPC) protocol. While not designed specifically for
network management, it is now considered a more widely available and less
expensive alternative to CMIP/GDMO for NEs whose management requirements can
not be easily met by SNMP or TL1. Try http://www.omg.org/

5) HTML or XML. Starting to show up in IP equipment, such as network ready
printers. (Try pointing a web browser at a recent HP laser printer if you
have one on your network and see if it doesn't have a web server running on
it, along with an SNMP agent too!)

And then there are proprietary protocols, of which I have a small knowledge
of one or two:

6) TBOS (Can't remember what it stands for! A web search should help; very
simple alarm and control protocol.)

7) Badger and Larse low baud rate serial protocols for control and
monitoring of, for example, microwave sites. Try http://www.badger.com (I
consulted to Badger Technology for a while.)

James Logajan

2.02.01.03
I wouldn't suggest CORBA is a management protocol (it isn't) or that it
could be used as one.  CORBA is only a spec, not a product, and the
products from the specs vary so much they are often not interoperable.
CORBA is expensive to implement and difficult to manage.

[...]

However, Visual Edge makes a product called ObjectBridge that is a
COM/CORBA bridge that also has an SNMP agent built in, and generates
MIB files for the CORBA objects.  If you have to use CORBA to monitor
applications, as is often the case in UNIX when people try to use Java
for enterprise apps, this product would work well for adding monitoring
capabilities.

DMTF and CIM, and their associated technologies, like WBEM, are your
best bet for alternatives to SNMP.  I know of nothing else that is
industry-wide.

2.02.01.04
Microsoft has a new "standard" called WMI that tries to tie together
WBEM, CMI, & SNMP

the PartyMIB by a configuration file(s). The layout
of this initialization file is defined and described

     "The tkined & scotty network management system
 
     The Technical University of Braunschweig has developed an
     extensible network management platform which uses the
     Tool Command Language (Tcl) as its primary extensions
     language.
 
     The tkined network editor is the graphical user interface
     which integrates applications that are usually written as
     Tcl scripts based on the scotty Tcl extension. scotty provides
     access to SNMPv1 and SNMPv2 and a number of well known
     Internet services like DNS, various ICMP packets, NTP, TCP,
     UDP, SUN RPCs (mount, rstat, portmap) etc.
 
     Applications distributed with the scotty and tkined sources
     include network discovery, trouble-shooting applications, 
     event filter, SNMP MIB browser etc. An experimental MIB
     browser is also available via WWW using the URL:
        
     http://www.cs.tu-bs.de/ibr/cgi-bin/sbrowser.cgi
 
     The SNMP Tcl extension uses a SNMPv1/v2 protocol stack written
     from scratch which was designed to directly support our Tcl
     API. This provides a portable and fast implementation. A brief
     history on SNMP Tcl extension is available using the URL:
        
     http://www.cs.tu-bs.de/ibr/projects/nm/scotty/tcl+snmp.html
 
     Information about the current status of the project, the
     mailing list and the availability of our software can be
     found at:
 
     http://www.cs.tu-bs.de/ibr/projects/nm/tkined/
     http://www.cs.tu-bs.de/ibr/projects/nm/scotty/

     [Editor's note: Holger Trapp has informed me that all of
      the above URL's for tkined & scotty should be replaced by

      http://wwwsnmp.cs.utwente.nl/~schoenw/scotty/

     Another Scotty URL:

     http://starbase.neosoft.com/~claird/comp.protocols.snmp/snmp.html
     has links both to Scotty, generally my favorite tool for this work, and
     snmpy, which is written in Python.  There also are solutions in Perl
     and other scripting languages. [Cameron Laird]

2.10.01.09
     from UC Davis  & Wes Hardaker (see FTP list in Part 1 )

What is it?
----------

  - Various tools relating to the Simple Network Management Protocol
    including:

	* An extensible agent
	* An SNMP library
	* tools to request or set information from SNMP agents
	* tools to generate and handle SNMP traps
	* a version of the unix 'netstat' command using SNMP
        * a graphical Perl/Tk/SNMP based mib browser

    This package is originally based on the Carnegie Mellon University
    SNMP implementation (version 2.1.2.1), but has developed significantly
    since then.

Is it free?
----------

  Yes.  See the enclosed COPYING file for copyright details.  With
  this version only (version 3.4), I'm asking people to send me a
  postcard of your home city, area, or country.  I intend to arrange
  them into a logo, take a picture of them all, and use the picture on
  the ucd-snmp web page.  If you wish to send a postcard, please send
  it to:

         Wes Hardaker

         UCDavis
         Davis CA, 95616

Where can I get it?
------------------

NEW SERVER (5/99)

Which versions of SNMP are supported in this package?
----------------------------------------------------

  SNMPv1, SNMPv2p, and SNMPv2c

			General info
			------------
Subcription/unsubscription/info requests should always be sent to
the -request address of a mailinglist.  In this case, send these
requests to ucd-snmp-request@ece.ucdavis.edu.  

To subscribe to a mailinglist, simply send a message with the word
"subscribe" in the Subject: field to the -request address of that list.

To unsubscribe from a mailinglist, simply send a message with the word
"unsubscribe" in the Subject: field to the -request address of
that list.

Do not send multiple (un)subscription or info requests in one mail.
Only one will be processed per mail.

NOTE: The -request server usually does quite a good job in discriminating
      between (un)subscribe requests and messages intended for the maintainer.
      If you'd like to make sure a human reads your message, make it look
      like a reply (i.e. the first word in the Subject: field should be "Re:",
      without the quotes of course); the -request server does not react to
      replies.


			The archive server
			------------------
The last 40 submissions to this list are archived for your convience.

You can look at the header of every mail coming from this list to see
under what name it has been archived.  The X-Mailing-List: field contains

2.10.01.10
     from pwilson:

"New portable SNMP agent distribution is available under GPL.
We call it snmp95. It is available for anonymous ftp from
          ftp://ftp.std.com/vendors/snmp/snmp95/snmp95.tar.Z

As well as number of other products named xxxx95 it is rather
a transtional product representing current intermediate state
of SNMPv1 -> SNMPv2 transition.

First, let me describe what is there.
 
1. It is bi-lingual SNMPv1/SNMPv2 implementation based on the
   recent drafts, which will change along with draft changes.

2. It includes two agents: base agent which will compile and run
   on all kinds of UNIXes, but without MIB-II and agent which will
   compile and run on SVR4/386 UNIX. Latter one has driver/kernel
   based (Karl are you reading ?) implementation of MIB-II for streams
   based TCP/IP.

3. Long time ago the thing was started from CMU-SNMP code, so it still
   shares common philosophy and some familiar names. At the same time
   basic SNMP library has error detection/reporting added to fully
   support new errors required by SNMPv2. Agent to MIB interface
   is also improved - MIBs can be hooked on the agent as binary modules.

4. The general design philosophy is to have a predictable minimal load
   on the underlying managed system from SNMP agent (e.g. agent does not
   use malloc's) while providing commercial level of capabilities: binary
   extensibility, fully implemented SETs and error-code support.
 
5. Admin/security portion of the code is separated from the rest of the
   code. So, if any new admin models will surface no changes in MIB or
   agent code will be required, unless some creative statistics will
   be stacked in.

6. Code is extremely portable. Practically 99% of system dependent
   code is contained within driver itself. I do not think that it 
   will take more than a couple of days to port it to something else.
   
7. Simple community based admin model codes are provided. An absolutely
   trivial one with base agent and a little bit more sophisticated
   with svr4x86 one.

8. Code is lightly tested in the respect that it will perform gets and
   get-nexts on all variables in MIB-II, supported by underlying system.
   It will also perform SETs on all read-write variables in MIB-II and
   in ipForwardTable, except tcpConnState. What was not tested yet is that 
   phase1 one of SET will reject absolutely all thinkable wrong routes
   without allowing for commit phase to take place: there is practically
   unlimited number of wrong routes. So, we tested against some most evident
   wrong ones but this is not finished yet."

There are several tools you can use. First of all is the ever popular scotty
(TCL/Tk) package for Unix.

The URL for Scotty is:

"sts is an SNMP trap switchboard, which can be configured to
display, log via syslog(8) or redistribute received traps to
other hosts.  The idea is to configure all network equipment
that is capable of generating SNMP traps to send all traps
to sts on a single host, under the assumption that it is
easier to adjust trap handling in a single tool than to
reconfigure a number of network devices whenever the
requirements of local network management change."

We have just released what we call the PowerTCP SNMP Tool, which is two
ActiveX controls, one for manager development, one for agent development,
and we have a MIB object that reads in MIB's and makes referencing OIDs and
values simple.  SNMP V1 and V2 are supported.  Details from our web page:

The SNMP version 1 and 2 Agent and Manager controls use a suite of
supporting objects that include a Mib Object (for loading Mib files), an
SNMP Message Object (for encoding/decoding packets), a Trap Object (for
presenting Traps), and a Variable Object (for building messages).
Download the SNMP Tool for a free 30-day trial!

SNMP Developers' Applications

a. Visual MIBuilder is an easy-to-use Windows application for
   creating or modifying ASN.1 MIBs for SNMPv1/v2/v3.
b. Visual MIBrowser is a user friendly Windows application that
   allows a user to perform Get, Set, or Walk operations on
   auto-discovered SNMP agents. It supports both SNMPv1 and SNMPv2.
c. Visual SNMP AgentBuilder for VB automates the creation of an agent
   in VB from a given MIB.  It can also be used for prototyping and
   simulating agents.
d. Visual SNMP xAgentBuilder for C++ is a C++ Code Generator for
   standalone SNMP v1 Windows Agent or SNMP v1 extensions DLL for
   NuDesign SNMP v1/v2 Agent Service or MS Windows SNMP v1 Agent
   Service.
e. NuDesign SNMP v1/v2 Agent is a seamless upgrade of extensible MS
   NT 4.0 SNMP v1 Service to SNMP v1/v2 Service

SNMP Developers' Controls

These SNMP v1/v2 controls are developed for use with Visual Basic and
Visual C++. You can create standard windows-based or browser-based
(Internet Explorer ActiveX) applications with these easy-to-use
controls.

a. SNMP Trap Sender - This control manages all the requirements
   for sending SNMP v1 and v2 traps in your applications.
b. SNMP Trap Receiver - This control manages all the
   requirements for receiving SNMP v1 and v2 traps in your applications.
c. SNMP Management control - This control manages the
   requirements for making SNMP v1 and v2 requests to SNMP agents from your
   application Provides the same functionality as WinSnmp.
d. SNMP MIB Loader component - This ActiveX component parses
   v1/v2 SMI MIBs and generates collections of MIB objects.
e. SNMP Agent Discovery control - This sends an SNMP request to
   a range of IP node addresses at a port that you specify, and builds a
   list from those nodes that respond.

Getting started with SNMP on Windows NT

Windows NT comes with an extendible agent. You can install the extendible
agent, and a included MIBII extension, in Network in ControlPanel. Under
the Services Tab, you can press add service. The files should be included
on your CD. I don't think its possible to get the source code for the
extendible.

There are, however, source code available for extension agents. You should
be able to find a document called "Microsoft Windows NT ANMP Agent
Extension", by Steve Rosato, if you search in SDKs, MSDN or maybe
Microsofts Web-pages. This document together with the sample
(Toaster-agent) gives a starting point in developing own extensions. There
are also several extensions available from diffrent vendors.

Both SNMP Agents and Managers on NT (and Win95) use the SNMP API. There are
source code available for a simple manager called SNMPUTIL and SNMPWALK.
Try to search for these.  And of course it's possible to buy NT managers
form diffrent vendors.

ucd-snmp and Windows NT

  "The ucd-snmp applications (snmpget, snmpwalk, snmptrap,
   snmptable...) all work on Windows NT and Windows 95.  The agent,
   however, currently does not.  The agent was originally written for
   the unix operating sytem, and agent's in general are very operating
   system specific, so porting the (or any) agent to an entirely
   different platform, like Windows NT, would be a rather long task.
   The ucd-snmp toolkit has a very extensible agent that allows you to
   remove large sections of code from compilation easily, so porting
   the agent could at least be broken down into sections and tackled
   in small pieces."

Make sure you use the SNMP_malloc and SNMP_free routines. Also make sure
that you allocated (via SNMP_malloc) the varBindList.List memory

Well, you're in luck.  I finally found out what was going wrong myself.
There's a documented bug in Win95 which means extension agents don't work.
Nice huh? You have to install the winsock 2 update available from the MS
website.  Maybe this should go in the FAQ.  It mentions that SNMPAPI.DLL
is required, but not that you have to get a new version of SNMP.EXE as
well!

You have to do it directly by the windows registry. Microsoft
doesn't provides a tool to do it!!

Open the registry ->  regedit
Go under :
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services...
    ...\SNMP\Parameters\TrapConfiguration

Add a key representing the communities you want to support.
Under this key, add string values representing the machines you want
to be in your community.

Go under :
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services...
    ...\SNMP\Parameters\ValidCommunities
Add the communities that you which SNMP to Accept request from.
(I'm not sure if this key is used, because the NT tool to add
communities doesn't update this key!!).

you can find the MIBs for NT and related software (IIS...) at

The Win95 MIB should be provided on the Win95 CD in admin\nettools\snmp, but

If you want to test the toaster mib extension agent dll,
you must compile the toaster.mib file with mib compiler, mibcc
(this mib compiler is in NT resource kit CD)
when you compile the toaster.mib,
you must consider the order of mib file.
i think <<mibcc smi.mib lmmib2.mib mib_ii.mib toaster.mib will work>>
and then restart the snmp service and
retest the snmputil.

successfully compiled the toaster MIB as a DLL with a static link to

	4) Install the extension agent (i.e. toaster MIB DLL) in the directory
you defined in regedit/regedit32.
	5) (And this is what took me a day to figure out...)  Install
snmpapi.dll in c:/windows.
	6) Restart your agent Windows 95/NT platform.  Your SNMP manager should

Disappearing MIB Objects

I installed SNMP service on my NT4 w/s and ran perfmon and was hoping to
find the TCP/IP/UDP/ICMP objects to monitor them.. i just cannot find
them..any help why.. the documentation says they should show up!!

Some info I think I should add when i start the snmp service it says this
message :" The procedure entry point snmpsvcGetEnterpriseOID could not be
located in the dynamic link library snmpapi.dll"
But the service starts after that..

--Arni Raghu

This is a very common problem - The problem is that you've added SNMP after
you installed a Service Pack. You need to reinstall a service pack
(preferably Service Pack #3)

SUBJECT: More About CMU SNMP Software

2.16.01.01

I've released version 1.11 of the CMU SNMP Library.

	ftp://ftp.net.cmu.edu/pub/snmp  

This version contains a couple of bug fixes.  The most important one
is that it will correctly call the new parser to read the new mibfiles
(mib-v2.txt).

If you use our SNMP library, and wouldn't mind others knowing it,
please send me some mail describing what you are working on, and any
URLs you may have.  I'd like to collect this information and put it on
the CMU SNMP web site.

For examples of how to use this library, check out the snmpapps
collection:

	ftp://ftp.net.cmu.edu/pub/snmp/snmpapps/

An example of using the build-in miniclient can be found at:

	ftp://ftp.net.cmu.edu/pub/snmp/dns/dnscmd/

The main changes are:

Shared Library Support
----------------------

Now has the ability to build a shared library.

New Parser
----------

Added a new parser that will handle SMIv2 (and even some SMIv1) MIBs
without any MIB changes.  This was the #1 complaint about the previous
releases was the inability to use MIBs from within RFCs.  Now you can.

Check out ftp://ftp.net.cmu.edu/pub/mibs for more information on what
MIBs we've used without problems.  (Currently, we're using lots of
MIBs from RFCs, and from Cisco.)

The old parser is still there, so the file /etc/mib.txt will still be
parsed as it is now.  However, if the file /etc/mib-v2.txt (or the
env. var. MIBFILE_v2 is set), that MIB will be read instead.

I believe everybody that uses our software will be happy with the new
parser.

-Ryan

I've released a new version of the CMU SNMP Apps.  They are located
at:

	ftp://ftp.net.cmu.edu/pub/snmp/snmpapps

The major change in this version is the Win32 port.  Included is a
readme file that will tell you how to compile them under Win32 with
the newest CMU SNMP library (1.9).

The CMU SNMP library, available at ftp://ftp.net.cmu.edu/pub/snmp,
will encode and decode SNMPv1 (and v2) packets.  While it has a "C"
interface, the headers will correctly work with C++, and you can use
it there.

It does work in the Win32 environment, and currently comes with a set
of workspaces for Microsoft Visual C++ 5.0.

==ANSWER:

No.  V1.6 is the SNMPv1 package, modified to allow SNMPv2 requests.
It is not based on the 2.1.2 package at all, doesn't come with an SNMP
agent, and doesn't support parties.

Basicly, if you want to write an SNMP app, I'd suggest this library.
But that's just because it's what I'm currently using. :)

If you want an agent and/or the SNMPv2 party stuff, use the library
from ftp://ucd-snmp.ucdavis.edu/.

UCD started out from CMU 2.1.2. CMU 1.6 is a rewrite
(started from CMU 1.1)that offers an API and the simple

UCD has a reasonably complete (extensible) agent for

Does CMU provide an agent?

===ANSWER:

The CMU SNMP Agent was part of the older SNMP software available via:

We currently do not support that agent.  I'd suggest looking at the
UCD SNMP Agent.  It was based on this agent, but is more functional
and portable.

===ANSWER:

Yes.  Before you send each trap, reset the Version field of the
snmp_session structure to the appropriate value.

When the library decodes a PDU, it resets the version of the session
to what it received.  The version is only really used as a sanity
check when encoding V1/V2 specific PDUs.  If you change it before each
send, everything _should_ work.

The community string for all PDUs (V1 traps included) is the session
community string.  Just change it when you change the session Version,
and everything _should_ work as well.

-Ryan Troll

2.16.01.07

       Adding MIB to CMU SNMP 1.7

==ANSWER:

Basicly, you need to do the following:

* Make sure it's a v2 MIB (MAX-ACCESS, not ACCESS; etc.)
* Remove MODULE-IDENTITY entries
* Remove TEXTUAL-CONVENTIONs
* Remove DEFVAL entries
* Remove (SIZE()) constraints on anything
   (IE: OCTET STRING and DisplayString)
* Make sure the first quote on all DESCRIPTION strings
  are followed by a space

That's all I can think of offhand.  Typicly, I make these changes, and
then stick the new MIB into the MIBFILE, and see what fails.

I've been placing the MIBs I've modified for use with our parser in:

	ftp://ftp.net.cmu.edu/pub/mibs/

If anybody comes up with other MIBS that have been modified, or
changes that need to be made, please send them to me, and I'll add
them to the HowTo / put them on the FTP site.

parts of the cisco mib. therefor i wanted to include cisco mibs into
the mib.txt file. but i haven't succeeded so far.

there are a lot of parse errors. i even downloaded the modified cisco
mibs from cmu.edu but didn't work either.

what is the correct way to do this? what cisco mibs to use? just
append the mib to the end of the default mib.txt?

i've read the faq and found no clue. i would be very glad if someone
could give me pointers to get this to work. better even: a working
mib.txt with cisco's mibs already included.

The CMU code has a miserable parser when it comes to MIBFiles.

If you want some MIBs that will work with the CMU code, check out:

	ftp://ftp.net.cmu.edu/pub/mibs

Hey! Where's the Documentation?

==ANSWER
The only true documentation for the CMU SNMP Library, aside from the

are:

* The SNMP Apps collection (ftp://ftp.net.cmu.edu/pub/snmp/snmpapps)

* The BIND SNMP Agent (ftp://ftp.net.cmu.edu/pub/snmp/dns)

* DNSCMD: A small program to fetch data from the BIND SNMP Agent
(ftp://ftp.net.cmu.edu/pub/snmp/dns/dnscmd).

DNSCMD uses the snmp-mini-client, so it should be a good example.

Some of the other stuff in the ciscotools directory
(ftp://ftp.net.cmu.edu/pub/snmp/ciscotools) may use it as well, but I
don't remember.

If you want a lot of versatility in the use of enterprise MIBs,
as well as some fun, try SnmpQL from Redpoint Software
(http://www.redpt.com) .  It is an ODBC driver that reads SNMP
data as a database.   The ODBC driver setup has a built in MIB
compiler, and it ships with several MIBs.  Imagine tying in
SNMP Gets and/or Sets with an Excel spreadsheet, Access database,
etc.  It's a totally different approach than SNMPc or HPOV, but
it will give you some creative ways to use the NT enterprise MIBs
as well as the MIB-II structure.

I've played around with lots of SNMP code, most of it freely available. I've
found the best for Solaris 2.5.1 to be from MIT. It compiled without error and
the code was very clean, if a little too elegant. You can get it from
ftp://mercury.lcs.mit.edu/pub/snmp. However, documentation is thin on the ground.
I spent a couple of days with the code and it taught me a lot more than anything
else. I'm successfully building agents to monitor our remote applications and
databases with it. (If you need help getting started I'll send you the code I
have added so you can get a general idea)

It took me ages to crawl up the learning curve for SNMP. Everything seemed too
complicated in the beginning, and the FAQs were not all that much use. However,
I found a book that helped me a lot. [Total SNMP 2nd ed. (1998) Sean Harnedy

I am pleased to announce the completion of the new SNMP++
specification. Over the last year SNMP++ has gone from a version
1 specification, which was presented at a Birds-of-a-Feather at

The intent of the publication of this specification is to make 
SNMP++ an open specification as a C++ based SNMP API and as a C++

What is SNMP++:
-------------------------------------------------------------------
SNMP++ is a set of C++ classes which provide SNMP services to a
network management application developer. SNMP++ is not an additional
layer or wrapper over existing SNMP engines. SNMP++ utilizes existing 
SNMP libraries in a few minimized areas and in doing so is efficient
and portable. SNMP++ is not meant to replace other existing SNMP APIs
such as WinSNMP, rather it offers power and flexibility would otherwise
be difficult to manage and implement. SNMP++ brings the Object Advantage
to network management development.

You're better choice would be to use AgentX, which is a more recent
subagent protocol developed by the IETF's AgentX working group.  The
UCD agent has recently been upgraded to support AgentX as well.  CMU
has a sub-agent development library available, I believe, as well.

Wes Hardaker

2.21.01.03
The UCD agent now includes an *alpha* implementation of the basics of AgentX support,
true.  But this is by no means complete, or even likely to work on anything other than
a Linux system (and even there I'd offer no guarantees).

It's a starting point - no more.  It certainly can't be called "supported".
Maybe for the next release, but not just yet.... please!

Certainly for sub-agent development, the CMU library is a better starting point
at the moment.  The UCD work is much more closely tied in with the main agent code.

SUBJECT: What is a MIB?
-----------------
  A collection of objects which describe an SNMP managable entity.  
 
  An Important Note: There IS ONLY ONE SNMP MIB.  All these other
  "MIBs" which are cited herein are extensions to *the* SNMP MIB.
  Popular usage and strict definition do not agree on this point, so
  be careful in how and when you talk about the plural of MIB.
 
"Most people, when first starting to learn SNMP, believe that the MIB is a
database/datastore.  It is not.  The MIB does not contain data.  Nor does
the MIB retrieve data from your monitored product."

"When a network manager wants to learn about your node, be it hardware or
software, he must have some way of determining what information is available
to him, and what it means.  This is where the MIB comes in.  The MIB is not
a database.  It is a way of logically grouping data so that it is easily
understood by all.  When you design a MIB, you define and describe the
components of your product.  You also define and describe the data-objects
which the network manager would be interested in.  When building your MIB,
you logically place the data-objects within the product components that you
previously defined.  You now have a description of your product, and the
data-objects which a network manager may request.  At this point, you have a
simple MIB.  Note that your product is not running.  There are no values in
the MIB.  Only a description of each object.  And yet your simple MIB is
complete.  A network manager could look at it, and gain a basic
understanding of your product.  He could also determine what specific
data-objects he would like to query; after your product is running, and SNMP
enabled, of course.":

SUBJECT: What are MIB-I and MIB-II

  MIB-I was the first SNMP MIB accepted as standard.
 
  MIB-II added some much-needed objects, and has become
  the standard SNMP MIB.
 
  Note that SNMPv2 expands upon MIB-II with new groups
  and objects, and is therefore not MIB-II but includes
  MIB-II. See below for more about SNMPv2.

---

MIB-II is very old, and most of it has been updated (that which
has not is mostly obsolete).  Here are the RFCs with the updates:

On the following, "how can you convert a MIB in the SMIv1 format
to one in the SMIv2 format", the answer is that you cannot do this
mechanically. This is because there is more information content
in the SMIv2 format than the SMIv1 format. You can do much of
the work with a text editor, but not all. The process is covered
on pages 206-211 in "Understanding SNMP MIBs" by perkins and
mcginnis, and in RFC 1908 pages 1-6.

I don't know if it's still in service, but try to send your v2 mib
to following address:

mailto:mib-v2tov1@simple-times.org

[Editor's note: URL reported obsolete.
Mike Heard suggests "Try mailto:mib-v2tov1@dbc.fv.com"]

About Counter64 objects, there is no possible translation. You
should suppress them from the mib before sending it.

Olivier Miakinen

64-bit counters are not supported in SMIv1 nor are they supported in
SNMPv1 protocol. RFC 2089 covers the behavior of bi-lingual SNMP agents.

[post edited here]

The best approach for now is to NOT use the data type of Counter64 in
defining a new MIB object, and instead define two MIB objects.
One object is the low 32 bits of a counter value and the other object
is the high bits of a counter value. This places a burden on SNMP
applications, but is the best approach to be used until the high
capacity issue is addressed by the IETF SNMP community.

The format of MIB modules is independent of the protocol except for
objects that have data type of Counter64. This type is not supported
in the SNMPv1 protocol. So you can implement RFC 2233 using the SNMPv1
protocol, except for the Counter64 objects. RFC 2089 provides you with
information about implementing a bi-lingual agent.

If your tools support MIBs only in SMIv1 format, you can convert
them from the SMIv2 format to the SMIv1 format with MOSY and SMICng.
(I would suggest that you get a license for SMICng from SNMPinfo
at http://www.snmpinfo.com.)

David T. Perkins

2.30.04.03
2.30.04.03.01

You can use mosy to convert MIBs. However, mosy is not doing a very
good job in keeping things readable. It will also simply abort if it
encounters things like Counter64 object types in SMIv2 MIB modules.
Mosy is freely available.

There is a free embeddable SMI parser library package called libsmi
which includes a program called smidump. The smidump utility can
output SMI MIB modules in various formats such as SMIv1, SMIv2, SMIng
and mosy. Future versions will also support CORBA IDL and OID files
(JIDM mappings) as well as various ASCII formats to be used by humans
to analyze MIB modules.

Finally, you can use the SMICng compiler written by Dave Perkins. This
is a commercial product and probably the best compiler you can get
right now. (I am sure there are more commercial products you can use
that I do not know about.)

: More generally, where could I find a document describing how to convert

: Sebastien Annedouche

There is no such document. Some people in the SNMP working group said
that this is needed but others dislike the idea (probably because the
IETF should encourage to move from SMIv1 to SMIv2 and not in the 
opposite direction).

The smidump tool which is part of the libsmi distribution implements
a converter which takes SMIv2 modules and generates SMIv1 modules.
You may want to take a look at it. (The source code also serves as
some kind of documentation on how to do the conversion.) For more

  that network managers can use the MIB to manage some products from
  this enterprise.

The SMI parser I am using is based on JavaCC and I can highly

: Lee Braddock

Take a look at libsmi (http://www.ibr.cs.tu-bs.de/projects/libsmi/).
libsmi is a portable and embeddable SMI parser library which is written
in ANSI C and should be pretty easy to integrate in C++ sources. The
parser is a serious SMIv1/SMIv2/(SMIng) MIB parser written from scratch
against the latest SMI specifications. It does proper syntax checks
and also some semantic checks and is implemented using flex/bison.
The distribution includes several converters which also serve as 
examples how to use the library in your programs.

There is a mailing list you can join in case you find a bugs or you want 
to contribute patches for additional semantic checks or code generation.

The new mib-compiler supports both SMIv2 and SMIv1. It can compile published
IETF and IANA ASN.1 mib files. We have tested most the IETF and IANA mib
definition.

The new mib-compiler is fully functional.

The front-end compiler is based on "libsmi", a new advanced mib-compiler and
mib processing related tool-set.  It has several back-ends to various formats
including SMIng, SMIv1, SMIv2, import, type-query and more.

I wonder if someone out there knows, where I can find useful information
about the structure of the Microsoft MIB-Namespace (1.3.6.1.4.1.311...).

.311.1.2.1.4 microsoft.software.Wins.Datafiles
.311.1.2.1.5 microsoft.software.Wins.Cmd

These are the top level OIDs. From here it gets very detailed. I have
found that the MIB instance returned is rather long and after study
reveals that MS Mibs return the value as a numeric mapping. i.e. 100 =
A, 101 = B, 103 = C ......

If you search the keyword WINS.MIB or DHCP.MIB in the TechNet, you
should find something.

The first two bytes are the year (0x07CD = 1997)

	8th byte is "deci-seconds"

	9th byte is either 2B (ascii "+") or 2D ("-"),
	indicating direction from UTC.

	10th byte is hours from UTC.

	11th byte is minutes from UTC.

Oct 10th, 1997, 10:01:02.0 -6 UTC

See RFC-1903, DateAndTime TEXTUAL-CONVENTION definition.

===

This problem would be much easier to figure out if you
provided the MIB definition. There is no one standard
format for storing date/time values.
 
The hex value 07cd in decimal is 1997.

The hex value 002d0600 could be the number of nano seconds, but
you can only determine this by reading the MIB definition.

In SNMPv1, there is no "automated" way of "discovering" what MIBs an agent
supports, so, yes, you would have to query something in each MIB module to
verify it (not that this would verify that the agent supported everything in
these modules).  I'm not sure what the difference between your two questions
was, though, since the only thing different seems to be that you used the word
"dynamically" the first time.  This, unfortunately, does not make any sense, as
everything in SNMP is more-or-less "dynamic".

In the now historical (some say hysterical ;-}) SNMPv2, they introduced a
mechanism which is being carried forward to the now-proposed SNMPv3: agent
capabilities statements and other MIB techniques for defining explicitly what
groups of attributes an agent supports.  These features are not yet widely
supported, nor is it clear exactly what role they will play or how solidly they
will be implemented.

Is there a standard way to represent a float as an attribute in a mib ?
The problem I see with an OCTET STRING or DisplayString is  that
in ascii text
	1.5 < 1.50
hence any comparisons may be mistaken. The only other way around
it that I see is to make every float item actually 2 items as such:
	float_val intenger
	float_exp integer
where 1.5 would be written as 15x10^-1 and
float_val = 15
float_exp= -1

However this seems extremely combersome. There has got to be a better
way.

--Randy Sharpe

Not in the spec or in the V2/V3 spec.  No way to create floats that are
universally understood as floats.  RFC1902 takes away the old opaque
declaration that possibly could have been used.  We are looking forward
to Counter32, Counter64 and Integer32 to carry numbers.  What do you
need to float?

"You cannot define a table "within a a table". To accomplish what you are

if the first table is indexed by object "myTab1Index", a second
table could be indexed by object "myTab1Index" (from the first table)
and object "myTab2Index" (from the second table). This subject
is pretty well covered in the book  "Understanding SNMP MIBs" by
perkins and mcginnis. Also, additional information about how to

This is a FAQ about counters.
The basic question is "Can counters be 'reset'." The answer is no, not
ever. If not, then how can the number of occurrences be obtained?
Answer, you obtain the value of a counter at the first of a time
interval and then at the end of a time interval, and you subtract.
Note, you must also accomodate for counter rollover and counter
discontinuity.

For a short description of counters, see

SUBJECT: How can I change a published MIB?

RFCs 2578-80 describes the allowed changes that can be made to MIB
modules. Changing the name of descriptors in "published" MIB modules
is not allowed. See section 10 of RFC 2578. (Unfortunately, this
section does not say "descriptors cannot be changed" directly. It
says this in a roundabout way with the last two sentences in
section 10.2).

[...]If the MIB module has not been published, then you can modify
it as much as you want. If it has been published, and the errors are
recognized soon, then you can modify it. However, if the module
has been available for some time and has been made widely
available, then you probably have to live with the problems.

David T. Perkins

2.38.01
SUBJECT: How unique must MIB variable names be?

1) OIDs are unique identifiers for all-space-and-time. An OID value
   is an ordered sequence of nonnegative integers that contains at
   least two members with the value of the first member restricted
   to 0, 1, or 2, and the value of the second member restricted to
   0 to 39 if the value of the first is 0 or 1. SNMP calls members
   of the sequence sub-identifiers. SNMP restricts an OID value
   to have at most 128 members, and no member can have a value
   greater than 4G-1 (4294967295).

2) For convenience of people, a label can be associated with
   each member of a sequence. Additionally, there are "well
   known" labels for OID values. SNMP reccognizes only
   "ccitt", "iso", and "joint-iso-ccitt" as well known
   labels for the first member in a sequence.
 
3) There can be multiple labels associated with an OID value!
   (Few SNMP utilities can cope with this.)

4) OID values in SNMP messages are sequences of integers. A
   sequence of labels is never used.

5) Most items defined in SNMP MIB modules are identified by
   an OID value. The exceptions are TRAP-TYPES defined in
   MIB modules in the SMIv1 format and textual conventions -
   either defined with a type assignment or TEXTUAL-CONTENTION
   construct.

6) All items defined an a MIB module have a label, which is
   called a DESCRIPTOR by the SMI. The descriptors for all
   items defined in a MIB module MUST BE UNIQUE. MIB modules
   are a somewhat arbitary scoping mechanism for definitions.

7) The SMI further restricts descriptors defined in MIB modules
   found in standard track documents to be unique. However,
   there is no such restriction on descriptors in non-standards
   track documents or descriptors in MIB modules created
   by enterprises. The SMI requires that MIB module names
   found in standards-track documents are unique. However,
   no such restriction applies to MIB modules created
   by enterprises.

8) People generally perfer to identify items by descriptor
   value instead of a sequence of nonnegative integers.
   However, for each example of identification by descriptor,
   a counter-example can be given that shows that the
   identification is ambiguous. For example, a single
   descriptor is not globally unique. A descriptor
   qualified by a MIB module name is not unique because
   MIB module names are not globally unique. A
   sequence of descriptors is not globally unique
   because the descriptors for all the children do
   not have to be unique.

Only an OID value written as a sequence of numbers is unique.

2.38.03
SUBJECT: Explain MODULE-COMPLIANCE versus AGENT-CAPABILITIES

A MODULE-COMPLIANCE specification is a requirements specification.
It is a formal may to specify requirements.

A MIB module may contain zero, one, or many MODULE-COMPLIANCE
specifications. A MODULE-COMPLAINCE specification may specify
objects and notifications from MANY MIB modules.

An agent doesn't implement a MIB module. An agent
implementation may clain conformance to one or more MODULE-COMPLIANCE
specifications.

An AGENT-CAPABILITIES specification is an implementation specification.
It is a formal way to specify implementation characteristics.
An AGENT-CAPABILITIES specification may specify objects and
notifications from MANY MIB modules.

It is possible to have a program compare a set of MODULE-COMPLIANCE
specifications with a set of AGENT-CAPABILITIES specifications
to determine the coverage. However, since DESCRIPTION clauses
can be used to specify conditions or exceptions, a person must
also review such a comparison to possibly modify the results.

David Perkins

2.38.03.01

: Does anyone know what a "MODULE-COMPLIANCE" is for in a SNMPv2 enterprise
: MIB ?

You are talking about an SMIv2 MIB. There is an important difference
between the SMI(s) and the SNMP protocol(s).

: Does the agent have to control something here, or is it just a module which
: can be asked by any manager (with GET, GETNEXT...) ?

MODULE-COMPLIANCE definitions are never visible on the wire via SNMP.
Compliance statements define what an implementation must support in 
order to conform to a given compliance statement.

The interpretation of a compliance statement happens during 
implementation time (or marketing time if you will) and not at run 
time. An agent therefore does never instantiate any OIDs used to 
register compliance definitions.

SUBJECT: Which parts of my MIB are mandatory?


: Which parts of the MIB II are mandatory in SNMPv2c and SNMPv1?

: Manuel Rozier de Linage

You question suggests that you are confused by the mandatory
status value in good old RFC 1213 definitions. MIB objects
(or better collection of MIB objects) are only "mandatory" to
implement if they are applicable to your device and if you
claim conformance to something. The good old SMIv1 has not
been very clear about this. The good news is that this has
been fixed during the work on SMIv2.

Every SMIv2 MIB definition contains conformance definitions. And these
definitions describe in pretty much details what you have to implement
in order to be conforming to the MIB definition.

Furthermore, there has been work within the IETF to break the good
old MIB II (RFC 1213) into smaller pieces while converting things
to SMIv2 at the same time. So to answer you question, I suggest to
take a look at the following documents:

RFC 1907 (defines the SNMPv2-MIB)

         This includes the definition of the RFC 1213 system group.

RFC 2011 (defines the IP-MIB)

         This includes the definition of the RFC 1213 ip group except
         the routing table. Everything about an IPv4 protocol engine.

RFC 2096 (defines the IP-FORWARD-MIB)

         This defines the current version of the ip routing table.

RFC 2233 (defines the IF-MIB)

         This includes the definition of the RFC 1213 interfaces group.

RFC 2012 (defines the TCP-MIB)

	 This includes the definition of the RFC 1213 tcp group.
	 Everything about a TCP protocol engine.

RFC 2013 (defines the UDP-MIB)

         This includes the definition of the RFC 1213 udp group.

Everything else in RFC 1213 (at group and egp group) is historic anyway.

It all depends! It really depends on the data type of
the column used for indexing. Note that there are times
when values of some MIB objects are "pointers" to a row
in a table. It certainly is convenient to use the value
zero to act as a NULL pointer. Of course this only
works for tables that are indexed by a single arbitrary
integer. An example is in RFC 2233, see TCs
InterfaceIndex and InterfaceIndexOrZero.

SUBJECT: What is the SMI?

"In order for the MIB to serve the needs of a network-management
 system, it must meet two objectives:
 
 1. The object or objects used to represent a particular resource 
    must be the same at each node. [...]
 
 2. A common scheme for representation must be used to support 
    interoperability."  -  William Stallings, op. cit. below
 
In both Internet and OSI network management these two objectives
are met by a common structure of managment information (SMI)
which is defined in RFC 1155.  The SMI is the specification
for the tree of MIB objects which which provides a means of
associating a common numerical identification code for a
given object.
 
The top of the SMI tree is the familiar mapping:
 
iso = 1
   org = 3
      dod = 6
         internet = 1
            mgmt = 2
               mib-2 = 1
 
which is the global root prefix of every SNMP MIB object.

Currently, there is no precise grammer for SMIv1 and SMIv2. A while
back in time in July 1996, Dave Perkins published an I-D that described
a lexical specification of SMIv2. It was expired in 1997.

hopefully soon be obsoleted by full standard replacements with many
clarification, but no major changes. Take a look at

Good index design is one of the harder aspects of MIB design.

In the good old days of SMIv1, all indices were read-only columns
in the table where they were used. Then MIB designers started
using existing indices in new tables under certain situations.
Then SMIv2 was created that specified two important changes.
It introduced the AUGMENTS clause for tables that had a
one-to-one relationship between rows, and specified that the
usual case for access of indices is "not-accessible".
Then MIB designers went sort of crazy with specifying indices.

There is a white paper on the SNMPinfo site (www.snmpinfo.com)
that describes inter-table indexing. Some MIB designers think
it is too strict. However, if you follow it, your indexing
will always be valid.

SUBJECT: Floating Point Numbers in SMI?

You cannot add new base types to the SMI.

For now, the easiest way to have floating point numbers
in SNMP MIBs is to use the base type OCTET STRING and

This is not the most elegant approach. However, it will work
between your agent and your management application and it will
be compliant to the SNMP SMI and protocol specifications.

2.45.02
SUBJECT: Why is ASN.1 not Definitive for SNMP


2.45.02.01
The problem with ASN.1 in relation with SMI is, that people need the
old(!) version from 1987/88, since this is the version, SMI is based
on. Anyhow, I never tried to find out the relevant differences from
the new ASN.1 specs, and probably nobody ever did. The first paragraph
of the SMIv2 specs says

   [...] These modules are written using an adapted subset of
   OSI's Abstract Syntax Notation One, ASN.1 (1988) [1]. [...]

Frank Strauss

2.45.02.02
I cannot tell the context of the orginal question. But yet again,
to write an SNMP agent or manager, do not fall for the belief that
you need an ASN.1 compiler. Also, do not fall for the believe that
you need an ASN.1 compiler for processing MIB modules.

Whether one or not a asn.1 compiler is free does not matter, because
you really do not need one!

David Perkins

2.45.02.03
The ASN.1 language is used in SNMP for two purposes, which are:
1) to define the format of SNMP messages that are exchanged
   between SNMP entities typically called managers and agents
2) as the starting point for a language used to define the
   schema for management information. It is NOT CORRECT to say
   that MIB modules are written in ASN.1!

On the question of do you need to know ASN.1 to write SNMP agents
or management applications, the answer is no. However, you do
need to know some of the terminology. Also, if you want to know
why or how some part of SNMP works or the background on some
limitation, then you need to learn some of ASN.1 (the 1988 version).

SUBJECT: What is the Maximum Size of an SNMP Message?

2.50.02.01
"The limit on the message size is the minimum of the maximum that the
receiver can process and the maximum that the sender can generate.
The minimum can be no smaller than 484 octets.

A practical maximum is the size that can fix in a UDP message that
does not cause IP fragmentation. This is around 1200 octets on
Ethernet networks. 

Many networks use UDP messages that are around 4K octets, even though
IP fragmentation occurs. Going over routed connections where you
might get packet loss, you would probably not want to have fragementation."

David T. Perkins

2.50.02.02
The smallest __maximum__ SNMP payload (required) is 484 octets.  With UDP
overhead, comes to roughly 512 octets.

Individual SNMP messages on the wire can be smaller than 484 octets.  The
minimum __minimum__ size UDP packet, on ethernet is 64 octets.

Mark Ellison

2.50.02.03
If you are using UDP over IPv4 as your transport, and if you have a value so
large that it cannot fit it into a single UDP packet of maximum size, then
you are completely out of luck.  This can happen if, for instance, you have
an OCTET STRING whose size may potentially exceed 65535 bytes (less IP, UDP,
and SNMP overhead) and you wish to get or set the value.  So, you either use
a different transport protocol (such as TCP), design your MIB objects in such
a way as to get around this problem, or use a means other than SNMP to read
and write the objects.

"What should an agent return if it receives a request with an empty
variable bindings list? No error, ASN.1 parse error, general error, or
something else?"

Frank Foch

A response with an empty varbind list. RFC 1905 defines the VarBindList
as follows:

     VarBindList ::=
         SEQUENCE (SIZE (0..max-bindings)) OF
             VarBind

Hence it is pretty obvious that an empty varbind list is valid (and not
an ASN.1 parse error). Furthermore, there is nothing in the elements of
procedure which can cause errors in this situation.

SUBJECT: Master Agent versus Proxy Agent

"What is the difference between proxy agent and master agent
in SNMP field?"

John Huges

The definition of what a proxy is has changed over time. So lets begin
with a master agent:

- A master agent provides access to SNMP variables that may be provided
  by one or more subagents. The master agent usually uses a subagent
  protocol (AgentX, DPI, SMUX, EMANATE, ...) to interact with the 
  subagents. One of the key features of such an extensible agent is
  that it is complete transparent to the manager.

- The current definition of a proxy SNMP agent is an agent which acts
  like a gateway to other SNMP agents. This can be useful in order to
  pass firewalls or to map SNMP protocol versions. Such a proxy is 
  however not transparent to the manager since the manager usually
  has to select special parameters to address the target agent through
  the proxy.

- Early versions of SNMP used the term proxy also for agents that 
  translate non-SNMP management protocols into SNMP. This usage of
  the term proxy does not exist anymore in the SNMPv3 documents.

But even if you go to an SNMP working group meeting, you will
soon find out that the concept of proxies is something where consensus
tends to be rough.

SUBJECT: Proper Response to GET-NEXT on Last MIB Object?

: what should be the behaviour of an SNMP agent when it receives
: a GET-NEXT on the last element of its MIB.
: I think it must reply "NoSuchName". Am I right ?

: Sebastien Annedouche

It depends on the version of protocol operations you are talking about.

RFC 1157 Section 4.1.3 says that you return an noSuchName error. RFC 
1905 section 4.2.2 says that return a endOfMibView exceptions for those
varbinds that have reached the end of the MIB view.

RFC 1157 protocol operations are used by SNMPv1.
RFC 1905 protocol operations are used by SNMPv2c and SNMPv3.

SUBJECT: How can I find the SNMP version of an Agent?

> I need to find out supported SNMP versions / highest supported SNMP version
> of SNMP agents. Is there a better/easier way to do this than sending requests
> of the different versions and seeing which request you get replies on?

> Marcus Hellsten

There is no mechanism that will work in all cases. Security can be
set up so that you will not get back a response, even when the
agent is supporting the SNMP version of the request.
You need additional info, and how you get it depends on the system
and the setup of the system.

In the "standard" message wrapper, the values of the version field are:
0 - SNMPv1 protocol
1 - SNMPv2c protocol
2 - SNMPv2u protocol
3 - SNMPv3 protocol

SNMPv2p uses a different message wrapper, and doesn't use version field.
The SNMPv2p is defined in RFC1441-RFC1452.

SUBJECT:    A Special, Personal Thanks

My meager, threadbare knowledge of SNMP and SNMPv2 would be
all the more so except for the patient attention of
Jeff Case and Steve Waldbusser.  These two fellows are
not only masters of their craft, they are also true
gentlemen in every sense of the word. My gratitude.
