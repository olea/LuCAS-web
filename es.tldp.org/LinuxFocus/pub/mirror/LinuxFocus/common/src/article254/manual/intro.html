    <h1>Kino Introduction</h1>

    <p>Kino is a non-linear DV editor for GNU/Linux. It features
    excellent integration with IEEE-1394 for capture, VTR control,
    and recording back to the camera. It captures video to disk in
    AVI format in both type-1 DV and type-2 DV (separate audio
    stream) encodings.</p>

    <p>You can load multiple video clips, cut and paste portions of
    video/audio, and save it to a playlist (SMIL XML format). Most
    edit and navigation commands are mapped to equivalent vi key
    commands. Also, Kino can load playlists and save the composite
    playlist as a new DV AVI file. Finally, Kino can save a single
    frame of video (a still) in numerous file formats (based upon
    file extension).</p>

    <p>Currently, Kino does not support other video file formats or
    encodings. It does not support multiple layers or tracks of
    video and audio. It does not do image processing, titling,
    transitions, or effects. We plan to implement most of these
    features, but first we chose to focus on the basics of IEEE-
    1394, video, audio, and file input and output. We place a lot
    of emphasis on quality, stability, performance, and
    workflow.</p>
