In his wisdom RMS decided that people need no man pages
when they can use GNU's beautiful info system.
Unfortunately, everybody I know greatly prefers man pages.

Since GNU actively non-maintains man pages, and inserts
text to the effect that you should not be reading them
in each man page that they already have, it seems that
outside maintenance of man pages for the GNU utilities
is required.

The fileutils-3.16 man pages are being maintained both at
	http://www.lightside.ddns.org
and at
	ftp://mail1.bet1.puv.fi/incoming/
by Ragnar Hojland Espinosa and A. Wik, at first
independently, later cooperating.

The fileutils-3.16 man pages found here have been derived
from those in fileutils-3.16-man-0.4.tar.gz
(as found on ftp://mail1.bet1.puv.fi/incoming/)
by adding information on what POSIX says about these
utilities. This is very useful if you have to write
scripts that should be portable.
