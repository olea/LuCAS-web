>   Indexes are primarily used to enhance database
   performance. They should be defined on table columns (or class
   attributes) which are used as qualifications in repetative queries.
   Inappropriate use will result in slower performance, since update
   and insertion times are increased in the presence of indices.

>,
      the key fields for the
      index are specified as column names; a column may also have
      an associated operator class. An operator class is used
      to specify the operators to be used for a particular
      index. For example, a btree index on four-byte integers
      would use the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>int4_ops</TT
> class;
      this operator class includes
      comparison functions for four-byte integers. The default
      operator class is the appropriate operator class for that
      field type.

CLASS="FIRSTTERM"
>functional index</I

      on the result of a user-defined function applied
      to one or more attributes of a single class.
      These functional indices
      can be used to obtain fast access to data
      based on operators that would normally require some
      transformation to apply them to the base data.

>   Postgres provides btree, rtree and hash access methods for
   secondary indices.  The btree access method is an implementation of
   the Lehman-Yao high-concurrency btrees.  The rtree access method
   implements standard rtrees using Guttman's quadratic split algorithm.
   The hash access method is an implementation of Litwin's linear
   hashing.  We mention the algorithms used solely to indicate that all
   of these access methods are fully dynamic and do not have to be
   optimized periodically (as is the case with, for example, static hash
   access methods).

>Subject: Re: [QUESTIONS] PRIMARY KEY | UNIQUE

        What's the difference between:

              PRIMARY KEY(fields,...) and
              UNIQUE (fields,...)

       - Is this an alias?
       - If PRIMARY KEY is already unique, then why
         is there another kind of key named UNIQUE?

   </P
><P
>    A primary key is the field(s) used to identify a specific row. For example,
    Social Security numbers identifying a person.
   </P
><P
>    A simply UNIQUE combination of fields has nothing to do with identifying
    the row. It's simply an integrity constraint. For example, I have
    collections of links. Each collection is identified by a unique number,
    which is the primary key. This key is used in relations.
   </P
><P
>    However, my application requires that each collection will also have a
    unique name. Why? So that a human being who wants to modify a collection
    will be able to identify it. It's much harder to know, if you have two
    collections named "Life Science", the the one tagged 24433 is the one you
    need, and the one tagged 29882 is not.
   </P
><P
>    So, the user selects the collection by its name. We therefore make sure,
    withing the database, that names are unique. However, no other table in the
    database relates to the collections table by the collection Name. That
    would be very inefficient.
   </P
><P
>    Moreover, despite being unique, the collection name does not actually
    define the collection! For example, if somebody decided to change the name
    of the collection from "Life Science" to "Biology", it will still be the
    same collection, only with a different name. As long as the name is unique,
    that's OK.

   </P

>    As for why no non-unique keys are defined explicitly in standard
    <SPAN

    must understand that indices are implementation-dependent.
    <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>SQL</SPAN

    define the implementation, merely the relations between data in the
    database. <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>Postgres</SPAN
> does allow
    non-unique indices, but indices
    used to enforce <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>SQL</SPAN

   </P
><P
>    Thus, you may query a table by any combination of its columns, despite the
    fact that you don't have an index on these columns. The indexes are merely
    an implementational aid which each <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>RDBMS</SPAN
> offers
    you, in order to cause
    commonly used queries to be done more efficiently.
    Some <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>RDBMS</SPAN
> may give you
    additional measures, such as keeping a key stored in main memory. They will
    have a special command, for example
    <TABLE
BORDER="0"
BGCOLOR="#E0E0E0"
WIDTH="100%"
><TR
><TD
><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>CREATE MEMSTORE ON &#60;table&#62; COLUMNS &#60;cols&#62;
    </PRE
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
>
    (this is not an existing command, just an example).
   </P
><P
>    In fact, when you create a primary key or a unique combination of fields,
    nowhere in the <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>SQL</SPAN
> specification does it say
    that an index is created, nor that
    the retrieval of data by the key is going to be more efficient than a
    sequential scan!
   </P
><P
>    So, if you want to use a combination of fields which is not unique as a
    secondary key, you really don't have to specify anything - just start
    retrieving by that combination! However, if you want to make the retrieval
    efficient, you'll have to resort to the means your
    <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>RDBMS</SPAN
> provider gives you
    - be it an index, my imaginary MEMSTORE command, or an intelligent
    <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>RDBMS</SPAN
>
    which creates indices without your knowledge based on the fact that you have
    sent it many queries based on a specific combination of keys... (It learns
    from experience).
