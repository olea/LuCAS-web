>Accessing the extensions

To access some of the extensions, you need to use some extra methods 
in the postgresql.Connection class. In this case, you would need to 
case the return value of Driver.getConnection().

For example:

    Connection db = Driver.getConnection(url,user,pass);

    // later on
    Fastpath fp = ((postgresql.Connection)db).getFastpathAPI();

Class postgresql.Connection
                                
java.lang.Object
   |
   +----postgresql.Connection

   public class Connection extends Object implements Connection

These are the extra methods used to gain access to our extensions. I 
have not listed the methods defined by java.sql.Connection.

 public Fastpath getFastpathAPI() throws SQLException

          This returns the Fastpath <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>API</SPAN
> for the current connection.

          NOTE: This is not part of <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>JDBC</SPAN
>, but allows access to 
functions on the postgresql backend itself.

          It is primarily used by the LargeObject <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>API</SPAN
>

          The best way to use this is as follows:

 import postgresql.fastpath.*;
 ...
 Fastpath fp = ((postgresql.Connection)myconn).getFastpathAPI();

          where myconn is an open Connection to postgresql.

        Returns:
                Fastpath object allowing access to functions on the 
postgresql backend.

        Throws: SQLException
                by Fastpath when initialising for first time
          
 public LargeObjectManager getLargeObjectAPI() throws SQLException

          This returns the LargeObject <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>API</SPAN
> for the current connection.

          NOTE: This is not part of <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>JDBC</SPAN
>, but allows access to 
functions on the postgresql backend itself.
   
          The best way to use this is as follows:

 import postgresql.largeobject.*;
 ...
 LargeObjectManager lo = 
((postgresql.Connection)myconn).getLargeObjectAPI();

          where myconn is an open Connection to postgresql.

        Returns:
                LargeObject object that implements the <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>API</SPAN
>

        Throws: SQLException
                by LargeObject when initialising for first time

 public void addDataType(String type,
                         String name)

          This allows client code to add a handler for one of 
postgresql's more unique data types. Normally, a data type not known 
by the driver is returned by ResultSet.getObject() as a PGobject 
instance.

This method allows you to write a class that extends PGobject, and 
tell the driver the type name, and class name to use.

The down side to this, is that you must call this method each time a 
connection is made.

          NOTE: This is not part of <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>JDBC</SPAN
>, but an extension.

          The best way to use this is as follows:

 ...
 ((postgresql.Connection)myconn).addDataType("mytype","my.class.name"-
);
 ...

          where myconn is an open Connection to postgresql.

          The handling class must extend postgresql.util.PGobject

        See Also:
                PGobject

Fastpath

Fastpath is an <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>API</SPAN
> that exists within the libpq C interface, and 
allows a client machine to execute a function on the database backend. 
Most client code will not need to use this method, but it's provided 
because the Large Object <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>API</SPAN
> uses it.

To use, you need to import the postgresql.fastpath package, using the 
line:
     import postgresql.fastpath.*;

Then, in your code, you need to get a FastPath object:
     Fastpath fp = ((postgresql.Connection)conn).getFastpathAPI();

This will return an instance associated with the database connection 
that you can use to issue commands. The casing of Connection to 
postgresql.Connection is required, as the getFastpathAPI() is one of 
our own methods, not <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>JDBC</SPAN
>'s.

Once you have a Fastpath instance, you can use the fastpath() methods 
to execute a backend function.

Class postgresql.fastpath.Fastpath

java.lang.Object
   |
   +----postgresql.fastpath.Fastpath

   public class Fastpath

   extends Object

   This class implements the Fastpath api.

   This is a means of executing functions imbeded in the postgresql 
backend from within a java application.

   It is based around the file src/interfaces/libpq/fe-exec.c

   See Also:
          FastpathFastpathArg, LargeObject

Methods

 public Object fastpath(int fnid,
                        boolean resulttype,
                        FastpathArg args[]) throws SQLException

          Send a function call to the PostgreSQL backend
          
        Parameters:
                fnid - Function id
                resulttype - True if the result is an integer, false 
for
                other results
                args - FastpathArguments to pass to fastpath

        Returns:
                null if no data, Integer if an integer result, or 
byte[]
                otherwise
         
        Throws: SQLException
                if a database-access error occurs.

 public Object fastpath(String name,
                        boolean resulttype,
                        FastpathArg args[]) throws SQLException

          Send a function call to the PostgreSQL backend by name. 

Note:
          the mapping for the procedure name to function id needs to 
exist, usually to an earlier call to addfunction(). This is the 
prefered method to call, as function id's can/may change between 
versions of the backend. For an example of how this works, refer to 
postgresql.LargeObject

        Parameters:
                name - Function name
                resulttype - True if the result is an integer, false 
for
                other results
                args - FastpathArguments to pass to fastpath

        Returns:
                null if no data, Integer if an integer result, or 
byte[]
                otherwise

        Throws: SQLException
                if name is unknown or if a database-access error 
occurs.

        See Also:
                LargeObject
          
 public int getInteger(String name,
                       FastpathArg args[]) throws SQLException

          This convenience method assumes that the return value is an 
Integer

        Parameters:
                name - Function name
                args - Function arguments

        Returns:
                integer result

        Throws: SQLException
                if a database-access error occurs or no result

 public byte[] getData(String name,
                       FastpathArg args[]) throws SQLException

          This convenience method assumes that the return value is 
binary data

        Parameters:
                name - Function name
                args - Function arguments

        Returns:
                byte[] array containing result

        Throws: SQLException
                if a database-access error occurs or no result

 public void addFunction(String name,
                         int fnid)

          This adds a function to our lookup table.

          User code should use the addFunctions method, which is based 
upon a query, rather than hard coding the oid. The oid for a function 
is not guaranteed to remain static, even on different servers of the 
same version.

        Parameters:
                name - Function name
                fnid - Function id

 public void addFunctions(ResultSet rs) throws SQLException
                       
          This takes a ResultSet containing two columns. Column 1 
contains the function name, Column 2 the oid.

          It reads the entire ResultSet, loading the values into the 
function table.

          REMEMBER to close() the resultset after calling this!!

          Implementation note about function name lookups:
          
          PostgreSQL stores the function id's and their corresponding 
names in the pg_proc table. To speed things up locally, instead of 
querying each function from that table when required, a Hashtable is 
used. Also, only the function's required are entered into this table, 
keeping connection times as fast as possible.

          The postgresql.LargeObject class performs a query upon it's 
startup, and passes the returned ResultSet to the addFunctions() 
method here.
       
          Once this has been done, the LargeObject api refers to the 
functions by name.
          
          Dont think that manually converting them to the oid's will 
work. Ok, they will for now, but they can change during development 
(there was some discussion about this for V7.0), so this is 
implemented to prevent any unwarranted headaches in the future.

        Parameters:
                rs - ResultSet

        Throws: SQLException
                if a database-access error occurs.
          
        See Also:
                LargeObjectManager

 public int getID(String name) throws SQLException
          
          This returns the function id associated by its name
          
          If addFunction() or addFunctions() have not been called for 
this name, then an SQLException is thrown.

        Parameters:
                name - Function name to lookup

        Returns:
                Function ID for fastpath call

        Throws: SQLException
                is function is unknown.

Geometric Data Types

PostgreSQL has a set of datatypes that can store geometric features 
into a table. These range from single points, lines, and polygons.

We support these types in Java with the postgresql.geometric package.

It contains classes that extend the postgresql.util.PGobject class. 
Refer to that class for details on how to implement your own data type 
handlers.

Large Objects

Large objects are supported in the standard <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>JDBC</SPAN
> specification. 
However, that interface is limited, and the api provided by PostgreSQL 
allows for random access to the objects contents, as if it was a local 
file.

The postgresql.largeobject package profides to Java the libpq C 
interface's large object <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>API</SPAN
>. It consists of two classes, 
LargeObjectManager, which deals with creating, opening and deleting 
large obejects, and LargeObject which deals with an individual object.

Class postgresql.largeobject.LargeObject

java.lang.Object
   |
   +----postgresql.largeobject.LargeObject

public class LargeObject extends Object

This class implements the large object interface to postgresql.

   It provides the basic methods required to run the interface, plus a 
pair of methods that provide InputStream and OutputStream classes for 
this object.

   Normally, client code would use the getAsciiStream, 
getBinaryStream, or getUnicodeStream methods in ResultSet, or 
setAsciiStream, setBinaryStream, or setUnicodeStream methods in 
PreparedStatement to access Large Objects.

   However, sometimes lower level access to Large Objects are 
required, that are not supported by the <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>JDBC</SPAN
> specification.

   Refer to postgresql.largeobject.LargeObjectManager on how to gain 
access to a Large Object, or how to create one.

   |
   +----postgresql.largeobject.LargeObjectManager

public class LargeObjectManager extends Object

This class implements the large object interface to postgresql.
        
   It provides methods that allow client code to create, open and 
delete large objects from the database. When opening an object, an 
instance of postgresql.largeobject.LargeObject is returned, and its 
methods then allow access to the object.

This class can only be created by postgresql.Connection

To get access to this class, use the following segment of code:

 import postgresql.largeobject.*;
 Connection  conn;
 LargeObjectManager lobj;
 ... code that opens a connection ...
 lobj = ((postgresql.Connection)myconn).getLargeObjectAPI();

Normally, client code would use the getAsciiStream, getBinaryStream, 
or getUnicodeStream methods in ResultSet, or setAsciiStream, 
setBinaryStream, or setUnicodeStream methods in PreparedStatement to 
access Large Objects.

   However, sometimes lower level access to Large Objects are 
required, that are not supported by the <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"

                on error

Object Serialisation
PostgreSQL is not a normal SQL Database. It is far more extensible 
than most other databases, and does support Object Oriented features 
that are unique to it. 

One of the consequences of this, is that you can have one table refer 
to a row in another table. For example:

test=&#62; create table users (username name,fullname text);
CREATE
test=&#62; create table server (servername name,adminuser users);
CREATE
test=&#62; insert into users values ('peter','Peter Mount');
INSERT 2610132 1
test=&#62; insert into server values ('maidast',2610132::users);
INSERT 2610133 1
test=&#62; select * from users;
username|fullname      
--------+--------------
peter   |Peter Mount   
(1 row)

test=&#62; select * from server;
servername|adminuser
----------+---------
maidast   |  2610132
(1 row)

Ok, the above example shows that we can use a table name as a field, 
and the row's oid value is stored in that field.

What does this have to do with Java?

In Java, you can store an object to a Stream as long as it's class 
implements the java.io.Serializable interface. This process, known as 
Object Serialization, can be used to store complex objects into the 
database.

Now, under <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>JDBC</SPAN
>, you would have to use a LargeObject to store them. 
However, you cannot perform queries on those objects.

What the postgresql.util.Serialize class does, is provide a means of 
storing an object as a table, and to retrieve that object from a 
table. In most cases, you would not need to access this class direct, 
but you would use the PreparedStatement.setObject() and 
ResultSet.getObject() methods. Those methods will check the objects 
class name against the table's in the database. If a match is found, 
it assumes that the object is a Serialized object, and retrieves it 
from that table. As it does so, if the object contains other 
serialized objects, then it recurses down the tree.

Sound's complicated? In fact, it's simpler than what I wrote - it's 
just difficult to explain.

The only time you would access this class, is to use the create() 
methods. These are not used by the driver, but issue one or more 
"create table" statements to the database, based on a Java Object or 
Class that you want to serialize.

Oh, one last thing. If your object contains a line like:

     public int oid;

then, when the object is retrieved from the table, it is set to the 
oid within the table. Then, if the object is modified, and re-
serialized, the existing entry is updated.

If the oid variable is not present, then when the object is 
serialized, it is always inserted into the table, and any existing 
entry in the table is preserved.

Setting oid to 0 before serialization, will also cause the object to 
be inserted. This enables an object to be duplicated in the database.

Class postgresql.util.Serialize

java.lang.Object
   |
   +----postgresql.util.Serialize

   public class Serialize extends Object

   This class uses PostgreSQL's object oriented features to store Java 
Objects. It does this by mapping a Java Class name to a table in the 
database. Each entry in this new table then represents a Serialized 
instance of this class. As each entry has an OID (Object IDentifier), 
this OID can be included in another table. This is too complex to show 
here, and will be documented in the main documents in more detail.

Constructors

 public Serialize(Connection c,
                  String type) throws SQLException

          This creates an instance that can be used to serialize 
ordeserialize a Java object from a PostgreSQL table.

Methods

 public Object fetch(int oid) throws SQLException

          This fetches an object from a table, given it's OID

        Parameters:
                oid - The oid of the object

        Returns:
                Object relating to oid

        Throws: SQLException
                on error

 public int store(Object o) throws SQLException

          This stores an object into a table, returning it's OID.

          If the object has an int called OID, and it is &#62; 0, then 
that value is used for the OID, and the table will be updated. If the 
value of OID is 0, then a new row will be created, and the value of 
OID will be set in the object. This enables an object's value in the 
database to be updateable. If the object has no int called OID, then 
the object is stored. However if the object is later retrieved, 
amended and stored again, it's new state will be appended to the 
table, and will not overwrite the old entries.

        Parameters:
                o - Object to store (must implement Serializable)

        Returns:
                oid of stored object

        Throws: SQLException
                on error
 
 public static void create(Connection con,
                           Object o) throws SQLException

          This method is not used by the driver, but it creates a 
table, given a Serializable Java Object. It should be used before 
serializing any objects.

        Parameters:
                c - Connection to database
                o - Object to base table on

        Throws: SQLException
                on error

                   Returns:
                Object relating to oid

        Throws: SQLException
                on error

 public int store(Object o) throws SQLException

          This stores an object into a table, returning it's OID.

          If the object has an int called OID, and it is &#62; 0, then 
that value is used for the OID, and the table will be updated. If the 
value of OID is 0, then a new row will be created, and the value of 
OID will be set in the object. This enables an object's value in the 
database to be updateable. If the object has no int called OID, then 
the object is stored. However if the object is later retrieved, 
amended and stored again, it's new state will be appended to the 
table, and will not overwrite the old entries.

        Parameters:
                o - Object to store (must implement Serializable)

        Returns:
                oid of stored object

        Throws: SQLException
                on error
 
 public static void create(Connection con,
                           Object o) throws SQLException

          This method is not used by the driver, but it creates a 
table, given a Serializable Java Object. It should be used before 
serializing any objects.

        Parameters:
                c - Connection to database
                o - Object to base table on

        Throws: SQLException
                on error
                
 public static void create(Connection con,
                           Class c) throws SQLException

          This method is not used by the driver, but it creates a 
table, given a Serializable Java Object. It should be used before 
serializing any objects.

        Parameters:
                c - Connection to database
                o - Class to base table on

        Throws: SQLException
                on error

 public static String toPostgreSQL(String name) throws SQLException
          
          This converts a Java Class name to a postgresql table, by
          replacing . with _

          Because of this, a Class name may not have _ in the name.

          Another limitation, is that the entire class name (including
          packages) cannot be longer than 31 characters (a limit 
forced by PostgreSQL).

        Parameters:
                name - Class name

        Returns:
                PostgreSQL table name

        Throws: SQLException
                on error
          
 public static String toClassName(String name) throws SQLException

          This converts a postgresql table to a Java Class name, by
          replacing _ with .

        Parameters:
                name - PostgreSQL table name
  
        Returns:
                Class name

        Throws: SQLException
                on error

java.lang.Object
   |
   +----postgresql.util.PGobject

   public class PGobject extends Object implements Serializable, 
Cloneable
               
   This class is used to describe data types that are unknown by
     <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>JDBC</SPAN
> 
Standard.
    A call to postgresql.Connection permits a class that extends this 
class to be associated with a named type. This is how the 
postgresql.geometric package operates.
    ResultSet.getObject() will return this class for any type that is 
not recognised on having it's own handler. Because of this, any 
postgresql data type is supported.

Constructors

 public PGobject()

          This is called by postgresql.Connection.getObject() to 
create the object.

Methods

 public final void setType(String type)

          This method sets the type of this object.

          It should not be extended by subclasses, hence its final

        Parameters:
                type - a string describing the type of the object

 public void setValue(String value) throws SQLException

          This method sets the value of this object. It must be 
overidden.

        Parameters:
                value - a string representation of the value of the
                object

        Throws: SQLException
                thrown if value is invalid for this type
    
 public final String getType()

          As this cannot change during the life of the object, it's 
final.

        Returns:
                the type name of this object

 public String getValue()

          This must be overidden, to return the value of the object, 
in the form required by postgresql.

        Returns:
                the value of this object

 public boolean equals(Object obj)

          This must be overidden to allow comparisons of objects

          This must be overidden to allow the object to be cloned

        Overrides:
                clone in class Object

 public String toString()

          This is defined here, so user code need not overide it.
          
        Returns:
                the value of this object, in the syntax expected by 
postgresql

        Overrides:

Class postgresql.util.PGtokenizer

java.lang.Object
   |
   +----postgresql.util.PGtokenizer

   public class PGtokenizer extends Object

   This class is used to tokenize the text output of postgres.

   We could have used StringTokenizer to do this, however, we needed 
to handle nesting of '(' ')' '[' ']' '&#60;' and '&#62;' as these are used by 
the geometric data types.

   It's mainly used by the geometric classes, but is useful in parsing 
any output from custom data types output from postgresql.

          PGbox, PGcircle, PGlseg, PGpath, PGpoint, PGpolygon
          
Constructors

 public PGtokenizer(String string,
                    char delim)

          Create a tokeniser.

        Parameters:
                string - containing tokens

Methods
        
 public int tokenize(String string,
                     char delim)

          This resets this tokenizer with a new string and/or 
delimiter.

        Parameters:
                string - containing tokens
                delim - single character to split the tokens

 public PGtokenizer tokenizeToken(int n,
                                  char delim)

          This returns a new tokenizer based on one of our tokens. The 
geometric datatypes use this to process nested tokens (usually 
PGpoint).

        Parameters:
                n - Token number ( 0 ... getSize()-1 )
                delim - The delimiter to use

   public class UnixCrypt extends Object

   This class provides us with the ability to encrypt passwords when 
sent over the network stream

   Contains static methods to encrypt and compare passwords with Unix 
encrypted passwords.

   See John Dumas's Java Crypt page for the original source.

   http://www.zeh.com/local/jfd/crypt.html

Methods

 public static final String crypt(String salt,
                                  String original)

          Encrypt a password given the cleartext password and a 
"salt".
   
        Parameters:
                salt - A two-character string representing the salt 
used
                to iterate the encryption engine in lots of different
                ways. If you are generating a new encryption then this
                value should be randomised.
                original - The password to be encrypted.

        Returns:
                A string consisting of the 2-character salt followed 
by
                the encrypted password.
              
 public static final String crypt(String original)

          Encrypt a password given the cleartext password. This method 
generates a random salt using the 'java.util.Random' class.

        Parameters:
                original - The password to be encrypted.
   
        Returns: 
                A string consisting of the 2-character salt followed 
by
                the encrypted password.
               
 public static final boolean matches(String encryptedPassword,
                                     String enteredPassword)
                 
          Check that enteredPassword encrypts to encryptedPassword.
               
        Parameters:
                encryptedPassword - The encryptedPassword. The first 
two characters are assumed to be the salt. This string would be the 
same as one found in a Unix /etc/passwd file.
                enteredPassword - The password as entered by the user 
(or otherwise aquired).

        Returns:
                true if the password should be considered correct.

Using the driver in a multi Threaded or Servlet environment

A problem with many <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>JDBC</SPAN
> drivers, is that only one thread can use a 
Connection at any one time - otherwise a thread could send a query 
while another one is receiving results, and this would be a bad thing 
for the database engine.

PostgreSQL 6.4, brings thread safety to the entire driver. Standard 
<SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>JDBC</SPAN
> was thread safe in 6.3.x, but the Fastpath
     <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>API</SPAN
> wasn't.

So, if your application uses multiple threads (which most decent ones 
would), then you don't have to worry about complex schemes to ensure 
only one uses the database at any time.

If a thread attempts to use the connection while another is using it, 
it will wait until the other thread has finished it's current 
operation.

If it's a standard SQL statement, then the operation is sending the 
statement, and retrieving any ResultSet (in full).

If it's a Fastpath call (ie: reading a block from a LargeObject), then 
it's the time to send, and retrieve that block.

This is fine for applications &#38; applets, but can cause a performance 
problem with servlets.

With servlets, you can have a heavy load on the connection. If you 
have several threads performing queries, then each one will pause, 
which may not be what you are after.

To solve this, you would be advised to create a pool of Connections.

When ever a thread needs to use the database, it asks a manager class 
for a Connection. It hands a free connection to the thread, and marks 
it as busy. If a free connection is not available, it opens one.

Once the thread has finished with it, it returns it to the manager, 
who can then either close it, or add it to the pool. The manager would 
also check that the connection is still alive, and remove it from the 
pool if it's dead.

So, with servlets, it's up to you to use either a single connection, 
or a pool. The plus side for a pool is that threads will not be hit by 
the bottle neck caused by a single network connection. The down side, 
is that it increases the load on the server, as a backend is created 
for each Connection.

It's up to you, and your applications requirements.</PRE
