	    ORCA - English-Spanish Glossary of Computing

This directory (ftp://quark.fe.up.pt/pub/orca/) contains the current
version of the ORCA glossary and other versions of it in various
formats:

    glosario.dict     Text version; it can be used with the dict
                      program.
    glosario.index    Index of glosario.dict, to be used by the dict
                      program.
    glosario.sgml     SGML version using DocBook's DTD.

    glosario.tex      LaTeX version (obtained directly from
                      glosario.dict, using dict2latex).
    glosario.ps       PostScript version generated from glosario.tex

    glosario.pdf      PDF version generated from glosario.tex

    glosario.html     HTML version

The different versions are labelled by a set of three numbers: XX.XX.XX
The first number corresponds to major changes, the second one
increases every time the editor reviews the glossary, and the third
number increases every time the general public modifies the glossary
(a value of 0 means that the glossary has just been reviewed by the
editor). The .dict and .index versions are updated every time the
glossary is modified, while the other versions are updated only when
the editor reviews the glossary; the file glosario.dict can contain
errors which have not been corrected by the editor; nevertheless,
you may use the programs dict2latex and dict2docbook to obtain the
updated version in the other formats.
